<h3>
Introduction
</h3>

<p>
Though the old literature of the Hindoos
is deficient in the department of politics&mdash;it
has no history, no orators, no Demosthenes,
no Polybius, no Aristotle; for the dialectic of
politics appears to have been invented by the
divinely discontented Greek&mdash;though, I say, it
has no politics, it is permeated with policy.  The
ancients, says Aristotle, wrote politically, but
we rhetorically: and his remark is admirably
illustrated by <i>e.g.</i> the old <i>Panchatantra</i>,
whose author certainly had in him as much
policy as Thucydides, although he chose to
deliver his wisdom in apologues, rather than
in the prosaic and somewhat pedantic
photography of actual affairs.  The Hindoo term,
<i>níti</i>, means, not so much policy, as diplomacy,
and so their <i>níti-shastra</i>, or doctrine of
policy, refers rather to the clever conduct of
affairs in negotiation, than to anything else.
And therefore, love-affairs, which we should
hardly include under politics, fall in with the
Hindoo conception, and in this sense women
are, as the Hindoos think, and their annals
abundantly testify, at least the equals, in
policy, of men.  When the author of <i>Eothen</i>
commended certain women of the Ægæan isles
for their admirable [Greek: politiue], he was using the
term exactly in the sense of <i>níti</i>.  And this
correlation of diplomacy and love is the
substance of the present story, the story of a
love-affair, in which, if we may believe a great
authority, the poet-king, Bhartrihari, the
special quality required and exhibited is craft.
The Hindoos in fact resemble women, and
women the Hindoos, in this particular, that
they are both of them apt to identify policy
with craft, and like rivers, generally prefer
to reach desired ends by crooked ways: and
this is why both of them, though often very
dexterous negotiators (like Wellington's "Old
Brag," whom he thought superior to Talleyrand),
have too much <i>finesse</i> to make really
solid statesmen.  For intrigue may be good,
in war, and it may be good, in love, but it
is not good, save in a subordinate and secondary
sense, in state-affairs.  Nothing durable
was ever built upon it.  Strength is simple,
but cunning is the weapon of the weak: and
there is probably more consummate "policy,"
<i>i.e.</i> diplomacy and tact, exhibited by women
in the conduct of their love-affairs in every
century, than has ever been displayed by men
on the great stage of politics in the whole of
human history.
</p>

<p>
And though the title of our story, <i>A Mine
of Faults</i>, might lead the reader to expect,
not without alarm, something geological and
mineral, and hard, and stony, it really plays
lightly with a somewhat softer substance, which
only disconsolate lovers in the depth of their
dejection ever venture to compare with rocks
or flints&mdash;a woman.  For here, as usual, the
Sanskrit epithet conveys two meanings in
one word: being, in one sense, a poetic
synonym of the Moon: the <i>maker of eve</i>, the
<i>lender of beauty to the dusk</i>: while, according
to the other, it means a <i>mine</i>, or inexhaustible
store, of <i>blemishes</i>, <i>defects,</i> or <i>faults</i>.  And
thus, as applied to a particular digit of the
moon, that is, a lovely woman, it keeps the
mind ambiguously hovering between her
lustrous lunar beauty, and her <i>faiblesse</i>:[<a id="chap00bfn1text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn1">1</a>] the
malicious implication being, that she owes her
attraction as much to her weakness as her
beauty: a paradox, to which the modern world,
anxious about the suffrage, seems disposed to
turn at present a deaf ear.  Dogmatism, on
such a subject, would be dangerous and
unbecoming: yet it would not be easy to deny
that her faults and imperfections, even if they
do not determine the attraction of the <i>vas
infirmius</i>,[<a id="chap00bfn2text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn2">2</a>] at least do not diminish, but
increase it.  <i>Infida, sed pulchra</i>, said the ancient
of his mistress: who knows, whether she would
have been quite so lovely in his eyes, had she
been true?  A doubt, or dispute, about
possession lends value to the property, in every
loser's eyes: and doubtless jealousy, while it
diminishes and tarnishes affection, increases
charm.  And indeed, no philosopher has ever
told us exactly what it is that excites the
passion of the lover to his "most emphatic
she."  Take any man you will, and you will
find that ninety-nine women in a hundred
will leave him unelectrified, unmoved: the next,
a very mine of faults, inferior, to every other
eye than his, to her ninety-nine ineffectual
sisters, will nevertheless act upon him so, that
her very presence will send the blood rushing
into his face&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Up his cheek the colour sprang,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he heard,<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and for her sake, it may be, he will cast into
the fire his family, his friends, his property,
his honour, or his life, or whatever else is or
is not his to cast.  No analysis will discover
to you the secret of the charm.  And yet, let
no man rashly call him mad, for is not every
lover mad, and does not this touch of Nature
make the whole world kin?  Only, each
requires somewhat different ingredients, to make
up that particular <i>mass of imperfections</i> that
appeals to him.  Who but a fool would fall
in love with faults?  Ah! but Nature, or as
the old Hindoos would say, the Creator is so
cunning; so well he knows how, by some
almost imperceptible distinction, some unanalysable
curve or touch or grain of composition,
nay, by a spot, a fleck, a blemish, an irresistible
defect, a "mole cinque-spotted," on the body
or the soul, to turn even the sage into a fool.
Explain it as we may, it is not perfection that
has inspired the great passions of the world.
Unless, indeed, anyone should choose to say,
that perfection consists precisely in a mass
of imperfections&mdash;and then he would agree
with the author of this tale: the
Moony-Crested God.

Being at Bombay, by accident, a little
while ago, I went down to the harbour, as
my custom is, to find a boat.  But as it
happened, such a gale was blowing from the
east, that not a boat would come.  They were
all cowering, as it were, huddled together on
the lee side of the quay, dancing madly on the
tossing waves, like corks.  Here, however, as
long ago in the case of the Macedonian Philip,
silver arguments prevailed: and at last I put
forth "in the teeth of the hard glad weather,
in the blown wet face of the sea," with
feelings which those only can appreciate who love
the sea beyond all earthly things, and live away
from it against their will.  So, then, we fared
on in the eye of the wind, tacking to and fro,
and shipping half the water that we met.  The
race is very strong, in Bombay harbour, at the
turn of the tide, in rough weather; we were
crossing it aslant, and in the turmoil, our
"patron" made a blunder with the tiller,
which drew down upon his grey hairs such
a storm of execration from his crew, who were
baling for dear life, that in his confusion he
lost his head and very nearly ended all.
We got across, however, but the violence of
the wind made it after all utterly impossible
to make the north coast of Elephanta, where
the landing-stage is, and therefore I had to
land where I could, upon the south.
</p>

<p>
I wandered through the woody isle,
startling equally the monkeys, and the men who
were constructing a new battery on the apex
of the hill; who, taking my method of arrival,
with the weather, into view, were strongly
inclined, as I imagine, to consider me a Russian
spy.[<a id="chap00bfn3text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn3">3</a>]  But finally that came about, which I
had foreseen: when I reached the cave, for
once I had it to myself.  The weather had
effectually protected it from all intrusion but
my own: and those bands of pleasure seekers,
who make it a place of horror and defilement,
and desecrate its holy solitude, were missing.
About it, and in it, was no noise whatever but
the noise of the wind.
</p>

<p>
I went into the cave, and sat down, at the
feet of Deity, close beside the shrine.  It was
growing late, for we had taken long to come,
and dusk was beginning to settle over its dark
interior recesses, making its projections stand
out strongly in the gloom.  Just before me
was the Marriage of Shiwa and Párwatí, dim
and huge, upon the wall: the gigantic figure
of the Great God, holding by the hand, to
lead her round the sacred fire, the Daughter
of the Mountain, whose attitude is a triumph
of artistic skill: coy, bashful, and reluctant,
with averted head, she seems as though
unwilling to place her hand in his, to gain whom
she had endured so many self-inflicted tortures.
And a little way off, in the darkness,
I could just discern the colossal Trimúrti, the
three-headed bust of Shiwa, whose central
countenance is filled with such majestic,
beautiful, immense repose: divine, immortal
calm.  And all round me stood about, here
and there, huge Dwarapálas, Pisháchas,
grinning Kirttmukhas demons and lesser deities,
satellites and servers and ministers of the
Moony-Crested God.
</p>

<p>
And as I sat, so little, among those great
Shadows, with the darkness growing deeper,
in the silence, was it fancy, or did they whisper
to one another: Who is this strange
white-faced unbeliever, who sits alone among us, as
if half out of devotion, yet without the flowers,
and the water, and the camphor, and the
lamps, and the mantras, and all the other
customary rites?
</p>

<p>
And I said in a whisper: O Moony-Crested,
be not angry: for surely I was thy
worshipper of old, in some forgotten former
birth.  And even now, is there among thy
dusky millions, even one, who has so sincere
a regard for thy dead divinity, and for that
of thy delicious little snowy bride, as I?  And
at least I worship with true devotion the digit
of the moon, that shines in thy tawny tangled
hair.
</p>

<p>
So I made peace with those old ghosts, and
we sat together in the darkness, and their
Lord put a thought into my heart, as I gazed
at him, while Bombay seemed to have faded
away into another world.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And then, after a while, I got up: and I
bowed to my Companions, and went away.
The wind had dropped, and blew us gently
home.  Night had fallen, before we reached
the quay: lights and shadows came and went
on the quiet water, dimpling round the tired
boat.  I stepped out, and disappeared in the
motley crowd of English ladies, native coolies,
Christians, pagans, Musulmans, Parsees, negroes,
Arab horse-dealers, British sailors, and
all the other national ingredients that it takes
to make Bombay.

<i>Hail to the Lord of the Moony Tire, whose
throat derives its blue less from the Kalakuta
which he drank but once to save the world,
than from the cloud of colour that rests for
ever like a ring around his neck, formed of
dark glances from the shadowy eyes of the
Daughter of the Snow, permanently fixed
with indelible affection[<a id="chap01fn1text"></a><a href="#chap01fn1">1</a>] on his face!</i>
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Long ago, as the God of gods was
playing in the evening on the edge of an awful
precipice in Himálaya with his wife, it
happened, that, all at once, that lotus-eyed
Daughter of the Snowy Mountain fell into
a brown study.  And Maheshwara, by his
magic power, penetrated her thoughts.  Nevertheless,
after a while, making as if he did not
know, he enquired of her politely: Of what
is my beloved thinking, with such intense
abstraction?  And hearing him speak, Párwatí
started, and blushed, and hesitated.  And
presently she said: I was but thinking of
my Father.[<a id="chap01fn2text"></a><a href="#chap01fn2">2</a>]  And then, the Great God
smiled.  And he said, looking at her with
unutterable affection: O thou Snowy one,
I see, that thou also art but a mine of faults.
Thou hast not told me the literal truth!  For
thou wast thinking, that thy own eyes
resembled that great blue chasm in yonder ice,
but that the eyes were superior.  And it was
true.  Then Párwatí blushed again, while the
god watched her with attention.  And after
a while, she said: Why didst thou say, that
I also am a mine of faults?  Then said
Maheshwara: Every woman is a mine of
faults, and thou art thyself a woman,
although a goddess, being, as it were, Woman
incarnate, the very type and pattern of them
all.  And it is very well.  For if women had
no faults, half their charm would disappear.
For, <i>apropos</i>, thou hast already blushed twice,
which thou wouldst not have done, at all, but
for thy feminine preoccupation about thy own
incomparable beauty, which led thee to
compare thy lotus-eyes with the blue mountain
ice, to its inferiority, and for thy shame, which
led thee to endeavour to hide from me thy
self-approval by telling me a fib.  And thy
blush is an ornament to thee, which I love to
look at, resembling as it does the first kiss
of early Dawn on thy father's snowy peaks.
</p>

<p>
And then, that lovely one blushed in
confusion for the third time, deeper than before.
And again she said: But why is every woman
a mine of faults?  Then said her lord: I
could tell thee many instances to prove it, had
I leisure: but as it is, just now, I have not
time.  And the goddess exclaimed: Out upon
thee!  Thou dost only tease me.  What is
Time to thee?  Do I not know that thou
thyself art Time itself?  And she began to coax
and wheedle and caress him, to gain her end,
knowing her own power, and certain of
success.
</p>

<p>
So then, after a while, Maheshwara said:
See now, if even I, who am a god, even
among gods, am utterly unable to resist the
feminine cajolery incarnate in thy form, what
are the miserable mortal men below to do,
against it?  Come, then, I will humour thee,
by telling thee a tale.  But first, I must
provide against the mischief that would
otherwise come about, by reason of my delay on
thy account.  For I can remedy the ill, which
thou dost overlook, preferring thy own
amusement to the business of the three worlds: but
it is otherwise with men, who, cajoled and
befooled by thy sisters in witchery below, often
lose golden opportunities.
</p>

<p>
And then, by his magic power, he suspended
the operation of the three worlds, so that
everything, animate and inanimate, fell as it
were suddenly into a magic sleep, and all
action stopped, remaining suspended on the
very brink of coming into being, like a
mountain waterfall suddenly turned to ice.  And
he said: When the story is told, I will
release things from the spell, and all will go
on just as it would have done before.  For
time, uncounted, is the same as none at all.
And then, he turned towards his wife, and
said: And now, where shall we sit, to tell
and hear?  Then she said: I will listen on
thy lap, as thou roamest through the air, for
so I love to listen to thy tales.
</p>

<p>
And Maheshwara took her in his arms.
And as they floated in space, she laid her
head upon his breast, and played with his
rosary of skulls, drinking his ocean-story[<a id="chap01fn3text"></a><a href="#chap01fn3">3</a>]
with the shell of her little ear.
</p>

<p class="thought">

<p>
And he said: There lived of old, in the
northern quarter, two kings, who were
neighbours, and hereditary enemies; and one was
of the race of the Moon, and the other of the
Sun; and one was king of the hill country,
and the other, king of the plains.  And the
name of the one was Mitra, and that of the
other, Chand.[<a id="chap01fn4text"></a><a href="#chap01fn4">4</a>]  And as fate would have it,
King Mitra was a man of peace, and a lover
of songs and pictures, and poetry, and ease.
And he married a beautiful wife, whom he
loved better than his own soul, and lived with
her deliciously until at last she died, leaving
him with a broken heart and nothing to
console him except her recollection, as it were
incarnate in a daughter who resembled her
exactly in everything but years.  But on the
contrary, Chand was a lover of war.  And
he spent his whole life in fighting everlasting
battles with all surrounding kings, never
resting for a moment: and he reduced them, one
by one, to submission and obedience, bending
down their stubborn heads till their crowns
were reflected all together in a ring in the
jewels of his toes as they humbly knelt
before him, like a crown composed of crowns:
for his military skill was like his stature,
gigantic.  And he married unwillingly, only
for the sake of continuing the line of his
descent; and having once obtained a son, he
turned his back upon his wife, and went away,
leaving her behind him, alone in his capital,
and carrying away with him his son, whom
he brought up in his camp, making him a
warrior, and teaching him, both by continual
precept and his own example, utter contempt
for every peaceful occupation, and above all,
for women.  And so he went on, year by
year, until at last, when his son was eighteen,
and still unmarried,[<a id="chap01fn5text"></a><a href="#chap01fn5">5</a>] for his father kept
putting off his marriage, saying: What is the
need of hurry? a necessary evil is better still
deferred: King Chand was suddenly killed,
in the field of battle.  And he just had time
to murmur to his son: Follow in my
footsteps: recollect my lessons: guard the
kingdom: conquer the regions, and above all,
beware of women: when Death took him, as
it were, by the throat while he was speaking,
and he set out instantly along the Great Road.
</p>

<p>
So, then, when his son, who was named after
his father, had performed his father's
obsequies according to the rites, he continued to
live, exactly as his father had, before.  And
after a while, his ministers came to him one
day, and said: Maháráj, this is well, that
the son should continue to run, like a wheel,
in the rut his father made.  But still there
is a difference, between thee and thy father,
which escapes thy observation.  Then said
Chand: What is that?  And they said: He
carried about with him everywhere, a son.
And Chand said: Ha! so he did.  Then said
his ministers: It is high time that thy
marriage also took place: and then in due time,
the parallel between thy father and thyself
will be exact, and thou wilt resemble him as
closely as the moon resembles his own image
in the water.
</p>

<p>
And then, Chand laughed, and he
exclaimed: As if it were necessary to get
married, in order to obtain a son!  And his
ministers said: It is absolutely necessary.
For a son that is truly a son can be begotten
only of a wife truly a wife, led by thee around
the sacred fire.
</p>

<p>
Then said Chand: Ye are all mere fools.
For if I choose, cannot I adopt a son, as
many of my ancestors have done before me?
And this is by far the better way.  For who
can tell beforehand what his own begotten
son will be like?  For many times a bad son
has issued from the loins of a good father.
But he who chooses a son, like one that
chooses a horse, knows what he is doing:
since he takes him for his qualities, visible
and sure, out of all that he can find.  And
in this way, the object is attained, without
having recourse to the expedient of a wife.
</p>

<p>
Then said his ministers: O King, if all
men were to follow thy example, the world
would come to an end.  For even adopted
sons cannot be adopted, until they are
begotten.  And if thou wilt not marry, others
must: or else thy plan is impossible and vain.
</p>

<p>
Then said Chand: Let the others all do
exactly as they please, and so will I: for I
at least will be an exception to this universal
rule of marriage.  For if women, as it seems,
are indispensable, in this matter of procuring
sons, I see no other use in them whatever.
What is a woman but a mine of faults?  For
she cannot fight, and is destitute of valour;
and she is absolutely nothing whatever but
a man deprived of his manhood, a weakling,
a coward, and a dwarf, and as it were, a
misincarnation of impotence, accidentally formed
by the Creator in a moment of fatigue, or
forgetfulness, or hurry, or it may be, out of
irony and sport: for there is absolutely nothing
whatever worth doing, which a woman can
do: nor can she do anything whatever, which
a man cannot do far better than herself.  And
linked to a man, what is she, but a load, and
as it were, a fetter or a chain to him, and like
a very heavy burden tied to the leg of one
running in a race?  And therefore, I see no
use in her at all, but very much the contrary.
For in addition to her incapacity, she is as
it were endowed by the Creator with a multitude
of positive defects: for she is everlastingly
shedding tears, and scolding, and what
is utterly intolerable, never stops talking about
absolutely nothing, so that the mere presence
of a woman is a curse.  Moreover, she is as
fickle and inconstant and capricious as the
wind, and less to be trusted than a cobra; and
over and over again, women have deceived
and betrayed even their own husbands, both
in love and war.  But the very worst of all
is, that they love a man less, in exact
proportion to his worth, preferring almost
anyone, no matter what he be, who flatters and
courts and overvalues them, to even a hero
who does not, abandoning, like flies,
everything, to flock to that honey which alone
attracts them, and demanding the sacrifice of
everything noble to their craving appetite for
frivolity and sweets.  Therefore for my part
I will live, never having anything whatever
to do with any one of them: nor shall any
jackal of you all persuade me to put off the
natural colour I was born with, and by plunging
into the vat of matrimony, come out dyed
all over an intolerable blue.[<a id="chap01fn6text"></a><a href="#chap01fn6">6</a>]
</p>

<p>
And hearing him speak, his ministers looked
at one another, laughing in their sleeves.
And they said to one another, behind his
back: How well does this young lion roar,
repeating by rote, as if he were a parrot,
exactly what the old one taught him!  For
what, forsooth! does he know of woman, who
has hardly been allowed to see were it even
so much as her shadow?  Truly, he resembles
a young black bee, kept in ignorance of
flowers and their honey, and taught to call
it poison, conceitedly lecturing older bees, his
brothers, about what he does not understand.
But we shall see, whether, in due time, we
shall not have the laugh on our side.  And
in the meanwhile, always provided he is not
killed like his father, beforehand, his error is,
at any rate, an error on the better side.  For
many a young king-bee, in his position, would
long ago have rushed into the opposite
extreme, rifling every lotus within his reach, till
he died of intoxication and exhaustion and
excess.  But as for him, lucky will that lotus
be, that first succeeds in opening his eyes to
what a lotus really is: for he will give her,
not the dregs of his satiety, but real devotion
springing from an uncontaminated well, pure
and delicious, of which no one has ever been
allowed to drink before.  And in the
meantime, we will wait, in expectation of the
change, which is certain to arrive.
</p>

<p>
So they waited: but time went on, and
Chand still continued as before, thinking only
of battle, and observing the <i>brahmachari</i>[<a id="chap01fn7text"></a><a href="#chap01fn7">7</a>]
vow, just as if there were no such thing as
a woman in the world.
</p>

<p>
Then said Párwatí softly to her lord: Sure
I am, that the god of the flowery bow[<a id="chap01fn8text"></a><a href="#chap01fn8">8</a>] would
have punished him severely for his
presumption, had he only heard him so outrageously
vituperating his sworn allies and darling
weapons as thou sayest.
</p>

<p>
And Maheshwara said: O Daughter of
the Snow, he was punished, sufficiently, as
thou wilt learn in due time.  For few indeed
are the young men or women that the
Bodiless god overlooks, seeing that of all of us,
he is by far the most jealous in exacting
homage to his divinity, as if he doubted it
himself, and greedy of extorting from
everyone acknowledgment, like a woman uncertain
of the affection of her lover, insatiably
craving to hear its avowal, over and over again,
from his lips.  And yet, perhaps the
greatest punishment of all would have been, to
leave him alone: since of all my creatures,
those are most to be pitied, whom love utterly
neglects, leaving them as it were in a night
to which there never comes a dawn.  And
who knows this better than thyself, by reason
of thy own extraordinary torture,[<a id="chap01fn9text"></a><a href="#chap01fn9">9</a>] before I
had to burn Love's body for his own
presumption, with fire from my eye.  But now,
hush! and lie still, and listen to the remainder
of the tale.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
II
</p>

<p>
Now in the meantime, all this while King
Mitra continued, living in his capital among
the hills, just as if King Chand had never
been born, with a soul that was divided, as
it were, with exact precision, between his
dead wife and his living daughter, who
resembled one another like the two Twilights,[<a id="chap01fn10text"></a><a href="#chap01fn10">10</a>]
so closely, that he could not look at his
daughter, without thinking of his wife, nor
call his wife back to his recollection without
bringing his daughter with her, like a shadow
of herself.  And between them his soul
hovered, going backwards and forwards, till he
was hardly able to discern, of the present and
the past, which was the reality, and which
only a dream.  And so as he continued, one
day there came to see him in his palace his
prime minister, Yogeshwara.  Now this
minister was well named, being very old and
very crafty, and in spite of the King's
inattention, he had borne the kingdom on his
own shoulders all his life, preserving it intact.
For his wisdom resembled his white head, and
there was not a black hair in the one, nor a
weak spot in the other: since both had reached
the perfect state of being without a flaw.
</p>

<p>
So when he entered, he said slowly to the
King: O Maháráj, certainly thy kingdom
hangs over the very brink or ruin.  And then,
the old King looked at him with a smile.  And
he said: O Yogeshwara, I know of nothing
in the world that could utterly destroy this
kingdom, except thy own death.  For then,
indeed, it would be not merely on the brink,
but lost and already lying at the very bottom
of the abyss.  But as it is, I see thee there
before me, in vigour and health.  How, then,
can any ruin be impending?  And Yogeshwara
said: O King, here is Chand, the son
of Chand, the very image of his father, for
he has all his father's warlike ability, with
youth and its energy superadded, about to
fall upon thy kingdom like a thunderstorm.
And during his father's lifetime, though my
hair turned white, as if with terror, and my
ear-root wrinkled, as if with anxiety,
nevertheless I managed, somehow or other, by the
aid of thy royal fortune and the Lord of
Obstacles, to turn his attack always upon
others, and keep him busy at a distance from
our territory.  But now, all other kings
being subdued, this young Chand, burning to
outdo his father, has determined to fall at last
on thee, being as it were ravenous for still
more earth,[<a id="chap01fn11text"></a><a href="#chap01fn11">11</a>] in the form of these thy hills.
And he has sent a message, saying: That
unless King Mitra will instantly make
submission and pay tribute, he will hear the tread
of King Chand's armies coming up towards
the hills[<a id="chap01fn12text"></a><a href="#chap01fn12">12</a>] like the roar of the rains in the
burst of their flood.  Nor is there any hope
that he can be resisted by force, for he and
his armies will sweep away ours, like a wind
scattering a heap of leaves.
</p>

<p>
So when he had spoken, the old King
looked at him again, smiling exactly as
before.  And he said: O Yogeshwara, certainly
this cloud seems to threaten a devastating
storm.  And yet, I am ready to stake my
whole kingdom, that thou hast already
devised a means of averting the catastrophe:
nay, of even turning it to our advantage, so
that this Chand-cloud, instead of sweeping
away all our crops in ruin, will on the
contrary water all our fields for another harvest.
</p>

<p>
Then said Yogeshwara: Maháráj, something
indeed I have meditated.  And yet, all
search would have been vain, and all deliberation
idle, had I not, by the special favour of
the Elephant-faced deity, discovered a
diplomatist far abler than myself.  And the old
King laughed; and he exclaimed: Ha! that
is news indeed!  O Yogeshwara, tell me
quickly, whether this wonder of diplomacy is
young.  For the time must come, though long
may it be coming, when, like every other man,
thou too wilt have to change thy birth for
another: and then I shall require him to
replace thee.  And little did I dream, that my
kingdom contained within it another such as
thou art.  Truly, I am curious to see him.
Then said Yogeshwara: Say rather, her: and
often hast thou seen her, for it is no other
than thy own daughter.
</p>

<p>
And as the King started, Yogeshwara said
again: O King, there are circumstances, in
which sex makes all the difference between
wisdom and folly: and cases, in which a
woman, just because she is a woman, will
make a more invincible negotiator than all the
ministers, from Dhritaráshtra[<a id="chap01fn13text"></a><a href="#chap01fn13">13</a>] down, that
ever lived.  And this is such a case, and all
the more, because the woman is such a woman
as thy daughter, whom I think that the Creator
must have framed, with an eye to this very
situation.  And now, then, I will tell thee,
that I foresaw this from the first, and I kept
it as it were stored in reserve as a resource
in the hour of exigency, to be, if the Lord
of Obstacles were only favourable, the triumph
of my policy and its crown, and the copingstone
of my career.  And with this very object
it was, that long ago, as thou knowest,
I obtained thy permission to cultivate thy
daughter, and to train her, and to tutor her;
and as I watched her growing, I said within
myself: Some day, this sowing of thine,
aided by my culture, will be fruitful, and it
may be, she will prove an instrument of
policy, to save the kingdom from destruction,
when every other instrument has failed.  And
very apt indeed was my pupil, and yet there
is another Master, who has done infinitely
more for her, in this matter of diplomacy, than
I.  For I think that the very God of Love
himself has befriended this kingdom, and
conspired to assist it in its need, lending his aid
to supplement my own insufficient efforts, and
mixing in thy daughter's composition some
bewildering ingredient, peculiar to herself.
</p>

<p>
And then, all at once, the King exclaimed:
Ah! no, not so.  O Yogeshwara, thou art
mistaken, for he took it from her mother.
Ah! cunning god, well he knew, where to find the
fascination he required.  O her voice! and her
eyes! and the smile upon her lips! and O
alas! for the sweetness that is gone for ever!
Aye! indeed, there breathed from every part of her
something that I cannot name, some spell,
some property, some fragrance, flung as it
were from some intoxicating source within her
soul, to drive me to despair.
</p>

<p>
And as the King stopped, sadly fixing his
eyes upon the ground, Yogeshwara said
again: Maháráj, whether the Deity took it,
as thou sayest, from the Queen her mother,
or invented it afresh, I cannot tell: but
certain it is, that the feminine delusion in thy
daughter is the very masterpiece of a Deity
skilled beyond all others in the production of
the irresistible: and old as I am, and versed
in all the varieties and ways of women, I
never saw anything that resembled it before.
And often, as I have watched her, innocently
casting what thou hast called her fragrance
about her in the air, with none to note it, and
all unconscious of her own inexplicable charm,
like a great blue lonely lotus-flower growing
on a silent mirror of black water in an
undiscovered forest-pool, never even dreaming of
looking at its own reflection in the water,
towards which all the time it bends, as if to
kiss it, absolutely blind to the loveliness that
almost touches it, and issues from itself,
depriving everyone that sees it of his reason, I
have striven in wonder to discover, exactly
in what the charm consisted, and in what part
of her it lay: and yet I could not, so craftily
has the Creator distributed it everywhere about
her.  And yet, musing over it alone, it has
seemed to me to be a thing compounded, as
it were, of contradiction.  For as you listen
to her, you are amazed by her intelligence,
and when you look at her, you smile as it
were against your will, and yet with an
inclination to laugh, from pure delight, so
strange and so surprising and somehow or
other, absurdly delicious does it seem, for such
sagacity to lodge, incongruously, in such a
casket, so dainty, and so delicate, and so
curiously and beautifully mocking as it were the
cruder mould of all her ordinary sisters, that
it leaves you puzzled and perplexed and
doubtful, whether to treat her as a woman or
a child, or something altogether different from
both.  And there is a sort of exhilarating, and
as it were, caressing sweetness, and a sound
resembling liquid laughter, falling far away and
yet lurking, somewhere or other, in the tone
of her voice, as it gives utterance to aphorisms
worthy of Brihaspati,[<a id="chap01fn14text"></a><a href="#chap01fn14">14</a>] that flatters and
intoxicates the ear, stealing through it straight
into the soul, and lending to everything she
says, even were it nonsense, a power of
persuasion not its own.  And as if this, coupled
to her beauty, were not enough, there is
something affectionate, and confiding, and as it
were, an appealing submission that is mixed,
I cannot tell how, with a kind of proud and
half playful, half serious defiance, that flatters
and delights and bribes and corrupts you in
her behaviour, and would utterly disarm you,
even if you were, what is absolutely
impossible, her enemy; so that if once you looked
at her, you would be helpless, and wholly
unable to be angry with her, no matter what
she did; for she would laugh at your anger
and beguile it, like a bewitching child
endeavouring to play with incomparable grace
the part of a woman, and challenging you to
find fault with her on any ground whatever.
And yet she has the cunning of her sex in so
large a measure, that she seems to have
monopolised it all.  And now I am a booby, and
all my experience is of less value than a
straw, if there is even one young man in
the eight quarters of the world capable of
looking at her for an instant without losing
all his senses at one blow; were he even the
very incarnation of asceticism.  But as to this
young Chand, I have followed him from his
childhood, by means of my spies, and know
him; and very cheap do I hold his
professions of misogyny and <i>brahmacharyam</i>, now
that his father is away.  For an old
misogynist may be in earnest, and actually mean
what he says, having been deceived and
betrayed and disgusted, by reason of his
experience of some women in particular, with all.
But the man whose wisdom is taken at
second-hand from another, and who is filled
only with the conceit of a knowledge not
drawn from his experience, finds it crumble
to pieces as a rule at the very first touch of
reality and life, like sand: since a single shock
to any part of his imaginary fortress brings
the whole to the ground with a run.  For
finding it untrustworthy in any one point, he
distrusts it all, and is left utterly defenceless,
at the mercy of his antagonist.  And of all
kinds of conceit, that of a youth, himself, as
Chand is, formed as it were of amber, on
purpose to attract the sex, like grass, who boasts
himself proof against a woman's glamour,
never even dreaming what it is or what it
means, is the greatest, and the shortest, and
the most easily annihilated, and the most easily
abandoned, and forgotten and forgiven, both
by women and the world.  And thy daughter
will bring him to his senses, and deprive him
of his reason, in the same instant that he sees
her: for then he will suddenly discover what
a woman means: since till now, she has been
to him nothing but a word.  And now, O
King, I have told thee: and now all rests with
thee alone.  For thy daughter must in any
case marry somebody: and where could be
found for her a better husband than this very
Chand, whose alliance would be the salvation
of the state?
</p>

<p>
And when he ended, after a while, the King
said, very slowly: Old friend, thy words
resembled a sword, driven into my heart.  And
as I listened to thy voice, holding up before
me, like a skilful painter, the picture of my
daughter's charm, I saw in it, as in a mirror,
another standing all the while beside her,
looking at me all the while with the affection in
her eyes that I shall never see again.  And
I flew back in an instant, carried on thy voice,
to old sweet idle hours, when like thee I used
to sit and watch and muse, striving to
discover the essence and the secret of that very
self-same charm.  And I would give a
hundred lives only to be young Chand, and have
that charm employed on me, again.  And if
he is able to resist it, I do not envy him, nor
think the more of him on that account.  But
let us try, and see.  For as to the wisdom
and the policy of what thou hast proposed,
there cannot be a doubt of it: and my daughter
must alas! be married, as thou sayest, either
to another, or to him.  Only they say, that
this young Chand is so declared an enemy of
women, as never even to suffer any one of
them so much as to approach him.  And how,
then, is the charm to work?  For in magic of
this kind, the spell will not act, unless the
magician be in contact with his object.  And
how, then, shall we bring about the meeting
of the charmer and the charmed?
</p>

<p>
Then said Yogeshwara: O King, I have
a stratagem to meet that very difficulty, which,
if my experience is not utterly at fault, is the
real, and the only one before us.  For could
we only place them in proximity, I am ready
to cut my own head off, if he can ever get
away.  And thy daughter will fall into the
scheme, and understand it, almost before we
begin to tell her, and require no instructions,
since this is a matter in which she is wiser
than us all: and to go about to tell a young
beauty how to lay her snares for her natural
and proper prey would be to give lessons to
the spider how to make his web.  Moreover,
I do not doubt that she will take part in the
plot not merely with avidity, but something
more.  For she has heard, as who has not? of
this young Chand, and nothing is so attractive
to the curiosity of a woman as a young
woman-hater: since every woman thinks, in her heart,
that she could perhaps persuade him to count
her an exception to his rule, and every woman
in her heart partly agrees with him, since, if
she could have chosen, she would have
preferred to be a man.  And women have been
adorers, since the beginning, of exactly such
young warriors of whom he is the type.
</p>

<p>
So, then, by Yogeshwara's advice, King
Mitra sent an answer to the message of King
Chand, saying: That King Mitra was ready
to accede to all King Chand's demands, and
pay him tribute in any such form as he might
choose, if only King Chand would come up
in person, under the safe-conduct of King
Mitra, to require it.  For the matter would
touch, in its adjustment, the honour of both
families, and the hereditary differences could
only be determined by personal arrangement
on the spot.
</p>

<p>
And when Chand got his answer, he said
to his ministers: See, now, everything is
settled, though I would rather have settled
it by arms.  But as it is, now, by all means,
I will go up, and give him the personal
interview he asks.  For I have never yet been
among his hills, nor seen his capital:
moreover, it is only fair to make concessions to
pride willing to be humbled, and families
careful of their honour.
</p>

<p>
And his ministers consulted together, and
they said: Maháráj, doubtless, the
safe-conduct of King Mitra is unexceptionable,
and above suspicion: for he is a man of his
word.  And yet, be on thy guard.  For
though King Mitra be incapable of deceit,
his minister, Yogeshwara, has almost as much
craft as the Creator.  For though he could
not make a world, he could preserve it, once
it was made, almost as well as its maker, so
unfathomable is his policy and guile.
Moreover, King Mitra has a daughter, who
resembles his minister in being an incarnation
of deception, only in a different form.  For
feminine beauty has befooled more men than
were ever beguiled by any other form of
fascination or illusion.  Therefore beware! for we
think it probable that a snare has been
prepared for thee.
</p>

<p>
And Chand laughed, and exclaimed: I am
obliged to ye all, for your wisdom and
advice, and now I am warned.  But the matter
is very simple, being wholly an affair of force,
and mine is by far the greater.  Therefore
there is no room at all for me to be beguiled,
even by Yogeshwara.  And as to the daughter,
little do I fear her.  For I have an armour
of proof around my heart, so thick, that never
an arrow from her quiver can so much as
reach it, were it sharpened even by the very
God of Love.
</p>

<p>
And then, the God, whose banner bears a
bull on it,[<a id="chap01fn15text"></a><a href="#chap01fn15">15</a>] paused.  And he said: O Snowy
one, it chanced, that when Chand uttered this
brag, it was the season of Spring, who, with
his flowers and his buds, was all around him
as he spoke.  And as fate would have it, he
was overheard by Love himself, who was
hovering near him in the air; for he happened
to be paying a visit to his friend.[<a id="chap01fn16text"></a><a href="#chap01fn16">16</a>]
</p>

<p>
So when that god of the bee-strung bow
heard him, he said to Madhu: O Madhu, who
is this boaster, who claims, notwithstanding
his extreme youth, to be proof against me
and my weapons?[<a id="chap01fn17text"></a><a href="#chap01fn17">17</a>]  For thou hast been here
longer than I, who have only just arrived.
</p>

<p>
And Madhu told him all about King Chand,
and his antipathy to women.
</p>

<p>
And when Love heard it, he looked at Chand
for a long time, with very great attention.
And after a while, he said: O Madhu, it is
very singular to hear such overweening and
presumptuous words, falling from the mouth
of such a youth as this.  For he is exactly
the man who in my hands would be a deadly
weapon against almost any member of that
sex, which he fancies himself able to resist.
</p>

<p>
Then said Madhu: Perhaps it is not only
fancy.  For often have I laid snares for him,
but always without success.
</p>

<p>
And Love laughed, with lips that curled
in derision like his own bow.  And he said:
Dear Madhu, thou shouldst have come to me,
for aid.  Thou art but half thyself, without
thy friend.  And he looked at Chand, out of
the long corner of his eye, that resembled a
woman's.  And he said: I have an affection
for these arrogant youths, for it is my hobby
and my delight to bring them to submission.
And now I will teach him a lesson, in his
own art of war, that he has still to learn, not
to despise his enemy; and prove to him, by
my own favourite method of ocular
demonstration, that a woman and my deity are more
than match for greater force than his.  And
indeed, the conjunction[<a id="chap01fn18text"></a><a href="#chap01fn18">18</a>] is altogether
fortunate.  For it so happens that I have by me,
just ready for him, a new just-opened
flower-intoxicant in the form of a young woman,
whose exasperating eyebrows alone, unless I
am much mistaken, will shoot, in spite of his
glorious brag, a poisoned shaft into his heart,
and sticking there, will sting it, with such
intolerable pain, as will hardly be assuaged by
a very storm of secret kisses, rained on the
flame of his desire, or dropped on his fainting
soul, one by one, with snow-flake touch, of
pity and compassion, from her dainty and
reluctant lips.

<h3>
A Diplomatic Interview
</h3>

<p class="t3b">
I
</p>

<p>
And Maheshwara said: So then, on a day
appointed, in the light half of the month of
Chaitra,[<a id="chap02fn1text"></a><a href="#chap02fn1">1</a>] King Chand and his retinue arrived
at the capital of King Mitra, just as his
ancestor the sun was rising over the hills on
which it stood.  And at the gates, Yogeshwara
was waiting, barefooted, with an escort,
to do him honour, and food and drink of every
description, to refresh him.  And he
introduced himself by name and family, and said:
O King, thy coming here is altogether
fortunate.  For see, the Lord of Day rises
auspiciously on one side, as if to greet and
welcome his descendant and rival on the other.
And now my old eyes are as it were dazzled, by
two rising suns.  And Chand said: I marvel,
that my very great grandfather has not long
ago died, of sheer fatigue, being obliged to
climb up here every day to reach thee, as I
have now.  For thy capital is one that
deserves to be inhabited by birds, rather than
by men, and now the world lies, as it seems,
beneath us in the clouds.
</p>

<p>
And when they were sufficiently refreshed,
Yogeshwara handed over King Chand's
attendants to his own, and said: Maháráj, as
for thee, I will myself be thy guide, for I
have matters to say to thee in private, which,
but for his age, our King would have been
here to say to thee himself.  And as he led
the King away, Chand said to him: O
Yogeshwara, though to-day I see thee for the
very first time, fame has told me of thee much;
and they say, that thou art a very mine of
craft, with a soul as full of snares as is a
hunter's net of holes.  And now I am afraid
of thee and of thy net.
</p>

<p>
And Yogeshwara laughed, and he said:
King, those who transact the business of
states, even for a very little while, make
enemies: how much more one who like me has
borne the burden of this kingdom on his
shoulders all his life!  And it is these enemies
of mine, who calumniate me, saying that I
am crafty: for all my friends know that I
am a very simple old man, who desires nothing
more than to shift his burden on to other
shoulders, and spend his life's evening in the
practice of austerities: which, if only the Lord
of Obstacles be favourable for just a very
little longer, I shall presently do.  But as for
difficult affairs, the King my master leaves
them in abler hands than mine, as in the
present case, with which I have no more to
do than just to be thy guide, as now I am,
to the minister entrusted with its management.
For our King's family and thine are hereditary
enemies, and there are some matters to
be settled of extreme delicacy, such as can only
be adjusted by one, in whose especial care the
honour of the family is placed.  And there
is but one, qualified to deal with this affair,
and it is, as thou hast doubtless anticipated,
no other than the Guru[<a id="chap02fn2text"></a><a href="#chap02fn2">2</a>] of the King: to
whom, therefore, I am commissioned now to
lead thee.  And Yogeshwara paused, for a
moment, and he said: Maháráj, it is known
to thee, who art versed in affairs, how important,
in matters of this kind, is absolute secrecy.
Now, eavesdroppers and busybodies abound, in
this city.  And therefore, it is given out, that
thy reception will take place in the palace
hall, where everything has been accordingly
prepared, to throw everybody off the scent.
But in the meantime, while all faces are turned
in that direction, I am instructed to conduct
thee, at the very instant of thy arrival, to a
place least of all to be suspected as the scene
of a diplomatic interview, and chosen with that
object by the Guru himself, where he will
personally settle everything beforehand, with
thee alone.  And in this way, no one will have
had any time to penetrate the design, and the
object is attained.
</p>

<p>
And all the while he spoke, Yogeshwara led
the King away, by winding paths that climbed
about the hill, through a wood, till at last they
reached a garden, whose air was loaded with
the fragrance springing from the jostling
spirits of innumerable flowers wandering about
at random like <i>wyabhicháris</i>[<a id="chap02fn3text"></a><a href="#chap02fn3">3</a>] looking for their
lover, the mountain breeze, out of jealousy
lest he should be sporting with their rivals.
And they came in time to a terrace that was
hanging as it were suspended on the very edge
of a precipice, about which the early morning
mists still floated, drifting here and there,
rising up out of the valley, that stretched like
a cloudy ocean, far away below.  And on
the very brink of that terrace there stood a
little arbour, almost buried in a bushy clump
of trees.  And there came from that
half-hidden arbour the sound of the humming of
innumerable bees, that were hanging like
clouds of another kind about the branches
that concealed it, and clustering around them
like troops of black lovers struggling for the
favour of the snowy blossoms which kept
tumbling from their places to lie strewn about
the ground like pallid corpses slain in the
madness of excitement by those boisterous wooers,
the bees.  And the delicious scent of those
blossom-laden mountain bushes was wafted
towards them in yet other clouds that were
invisible to the eye, seeming to say by their
irresistible aroma: What though you cannot
see us, we are not inferior to our visible rivals,
the mists and the bees, in making this arbour
a place without a peer.  And Yogeshwara
stood still, and looked towards it, and he said:
Maháráj, it is well chosen by the Guru.  Who
would ever dream of a diplomatic interview,
in such a place as that?[<a id="chap02fn4text"></a><a href="#chap02fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p>
And he looked at the King, and laughed
softly, rubbing his hands together.  And he
said: O King, the Guru, though he is very
old, would have been here before us, had not
thy activity in climbing taken us by surprise,
and even anticipated the sun.  But now I will
go very quickly, and bring him; and in the
meantime, the arbour is empty, and thou canst
go in without fear of any intrusion, before
his arrival.  For I have taken special care to
secure it this morning from all interruption,
even of its owner.
</p>

<p>
And the King went forward, pushing his
way among the trees.  And as soon as he was
lost among them, Yogeshwara went quickly
round those trees, and entered them on
tiptoe on the opposite side, and hid himself in
an ambush carefully prepared beforehand for
that very purpose by himself, from which he
could see and hear everything that passed
within, being himself unseen.  And he said to
himself: Now will I myself play the
eavesdropper, unknown to them both.  For in
matters of policy, nobody should be trusted,
but one's own eyes and ears.  And the best
way to hear, is to overhear, and to see, is to
peep.  And so will I make a third party to
their interview.  And though my own
diplomatic interviews could be numbered by the
score, certain it is, that I cannot recollect one,
to which I looked forward with even half such
anxiety as this.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
II
</p>

<p>
But in the meanwhile, Chand went through
the trees, towards the arbour.  And he said
to himself: Is it a snare?  Or can King
Mitra be intending to break his own
safe-conduct?  But in any case, I cannot exhibit
any fear, or even suspicion.  For what this
old man says, is plausible, and may, possibly,
be, after all, the truth: and then, I should be
utterly ashamed.
</p>

<p>
And then he came to the arbour, and saw,
in the wall towards him, a door.  And as he
looked carefully about, he saw, that the arbour
stood exactly on the edge of the cliff, having
only three walls, and being absolutely
without a wall on the side that ran along the
cliff, looking down into the gorge.  And he
paused, before he entered, saying to himself:
Ha!  From this arbour, as it seems, it would
not be difficult even to fall, without intending
it.  And now, a man might also very easily
be thrown from it, down into that dizzy gulf
below.  And therefore, it becomes me to be
very wary, and on my guard.
</p>

<p>
And then, he went up, and entered, cautiously,
the door.  And no sooner had he set
his foot upon the marble floor within, than he
started, and stood still, saying to himself:
Ha! there is a woman in the arbour.  And
now, I see, that it is exactly as I thought, a
snare, though not of the kind that I
anticipated.  And as my ministers said, this
Yogeshwara has led me straight into a trap,
with a woman for a bait.  For as he looked,
he saw, at the far end of the arbour, what
seemed to be a woman, kneeling on the floor,
with her back towards him, and bending over
a great basket that resembled an enormous
yellow gourd, filled with flowers to the brim.
And the whole floor was strewn all over with
flowers of every kind and colour, lying
everywhere in heaps.
</p>

<p>
And at the very moment that his foot on
entering touched the floor, as if roused by the
sound of its tread, she turned her head as she
kneeled, and looked round, and saw him.  And
instantly she sprang like a flash of lightning
to her feet, with a shrill cry.  And she bounded
like a deer to the precipice, and stood, facing
him, balanced on its extreme verge, with both
hands full of flowers, and both eyes opened
wide, like circles, filled to the very brim with
blue dismay, and her two brows lifted to her
hair with utter amazement, and terror as it
were written on every line of her body, that
quivered all over as if on the very eve of
another bound.  And she looked exactly like a
wild mountain antelope, suddenly taken by
surprise, cut off from its retreat, and just in
the very act of escaping its pursuer, by leaping
straight into the gulf below, and taking,
as it were, one last look of terrified despair
at the cause of its destruction, just before she
disappeared.
</p>

<p>
So as she stood, absolutely still, like a virgin
incarnation of outraged seclusion, the King's
suspicions vanished, at the very sight of her,
and his heart reproached him for her coming
death.  And he said to himself: I was wrong:
for it is beyond all doubt that I have frightened
her, almost to the point of self-destruction:
as what are women, after all, but cowards
to the core?  And if I stay another moment,
it seems certain that she will fall, even if she
does not leap in terror, into that awful gulf,
on whose very verge it makes me dizzy even
to see her standing, how, I cannot think.
Therefore I will go away at once, without
delay.  And as he so determined, he cast upon
her a single glance of contempt mingled with
disdain, just before turning to go away.
</p>

<p>
And in that brief moment of hesitation, he
gave the God of Love his opportunity, and
was lost beyond recall.  For as he looked
carelessly towards her, all at once, all his
contempt and disdain suddenly disappeared,
giving place to curiosity, that gradually changed
into amazement, and then wonder, so that
instead of turning, he stood himself absolutely
still, as if to imitate her, lost in his own eyes,
and resembling a picture painted on a wall.
And all at once, a doubt suddenly rose into
his heart, so that he said to himself silently:
Is it a woman after all?  For as he gazed at
her, her figure stood out, sharp and clear,
against the background of the sky, and the
empty space all round her and below her, so
that she seemed to hang in air, poised
somehow on the border of her garments that
concealed her feet on the very edge of that dizzy
steep.  And she was clothed in one long soft
robe of dark red silk, out of whose mass her
two bare slender arms that held in their
clenched hands her flowers stood like
incomparable curves of alabaster, round, and
miraculously still, and edged as it were with
delicate distinctness as if by a sudden stroke
of the Creator's chisel against the void
behind them.  And all about the graceful upper
portion of her body and her head was clinging,
like a cloud that had crept up to embrace
her out of the misty sea below and settled
affectionately in soft and loving folds about
her, a veil, that was woven as it seemed out
of golden films of the gauze of the setting
sun, fastened to her head by what seemed to
be an inverted silver moon, and through it he
could just discern against the slender slope of
her shoulder the swelling outline of her shy
right breast, shrinking beneath it as if in utter
shame at the outrageous immodesty of its
sister on the left, which owing to her attitude
was thrown out defiantly towards him, as if
to invite his admiration, and saying to him:
Find fault with my pure and perfect maiden
circle if you can.
</p>

<p>
And then, that very thing happened, which
had been predicted by the God of Love.  For
all at once, the tall twin semicircles of her
curving inky brow, on which astonishment sat
motionless, as if unwilling to go away, struck
him also with extreme surprise, so that like
a mirror of herself he gazed at it, with his
own brow raised in imitation unaware, saying
to himself: Why, it exactly resembles a bent
bow, drawn to the very breaking point, as if
to discharge a shaft.  And at that very
moment, her blue eyes struck him to the heart.
For there suddenly began to pour into his
soul, from underneath that strange intoxicating
bow, a flood of deep blue, and he utterly
forgot, as he looked straight into it, what he
was about, or where he was.
</p>

<p>
And at that exact moment, the Agitator of
the Soul,[<a id="chap02fn5text"></a><a href="#chap02fn5">5</a>] who, unseen himself, was watching
him intently, poised in the abyss, a little way
from the arbour's edge, became himself
violently agitated.  And he murmured softly,
clasping his two hands together, with entreaty
and emotion: O Wayu,[<a id="chap02fn6text"></a><a href="#chap02fn6">6</a>] help me now, by
some trick of thy art.  For yonder my victim
stands, balanced, exactly like herself, on the
very brink of the precipice of passion, and a
single touch will plunge him, headlong, into
its boiling whirl.
</p>

<p>
And the Wind heard his prayer, and came
suddenly to his assistance.  For all at once,
there leaped up out of that valley of mist a
gust, that caught the garments of that slender
beauty standing still upon its edge, and tossed
them into folds that fluttered round her lovely
limbs, betraying all their undulating lines and
hills and hollows, making her round breasts
rounder, and adding curve to her curving hips,
tearing away the curtain from her beauty, and
carving as it were her statue out of the soft
substance of her clinging red silk robe.  And
it lifted, just a very little, that provoking
curtain's lower edge, and showed him, for only
a single instant, her two tiny feet, with their
ankles, standing timidly together, and then
dropped it again, as if ashamed.  And
Kámadewa murmured in delight: Well done, O
admirable Wayu; again, once more.  And
once again the Wind obeyed him.  For it
caught up, suddenly, a wisp of cloud,
floating past as if on purpose to oblige the God
of Love, and tore it and sent it, driving and
curling, a little way above her pretty head,
between her and the sun.  And the shadows
of that broken cloud suddenly ran over her,
and showed her for an instant to the King,
now bathed in the kisses of the young sun's
colour, now darkened, as if by jealousy, by
the shadows of the cloud, that envied as it
were the kisses of the sun.
</p>

<p>
And all at once, as the King gazed at her
like one in a trance, she spoke.  And she said,
in a low voice, that trembled as if at its own
sound: Sir, this arbour is mine, and sacred,
and forbidden to all but me alone.  And
doubtless, thou hast intruded by accident,
rather than design.
</p>

<p>
And Chand looked at her as she spoke, like
a man stunned by a blow: all unaware that
she, and the Wind, and Love, and Spring
were all in conspiracy against him.  And he
hardly understood the meaning of her words.
But he said to himself, as he looked at her
in confusion: Was there ever before heard
in the world a sound like that low delicious
frightened voice?
</p>

<p>
And for a single instant, he looked straight
into her eyes.  And he wavered, and hesitated,
knowing neither what to say, nor what
to do.  And all at once, he bowed to her, and
turned round, and went away without a word,
the way he came.
</p>

<p>
And seeing him go, Yogeshwara in his ambush
bit his lip with annoyance.  And he said
to himself: Why, what on earth is she about?
For she has actually driven him away, almost
before he had arrived.
</p>

<p>
But the son of Brahma[<a id="chap02fn7text"></a><a href="#chap02fn7">7</a>] looked after him,
as he went, with exultation, and a mocking
smile.  And he said: Excellent Wayu, thy
delicious touches have finished him.  And now,
my business is done, and I need stay no longer.
Let him go, if he will: he will soon be back, of
his own accord.  Now, there is nothing in the
three worlds strong enough to keep him away.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And the Daughter of the Mountain said
softly to her lord: See, how Kandarpa[<a id="chap02fn8text"></a><a href="#chap02fn8">8</a>] is
always just the same, merciless, and jeering
at his unhappy victims, and adding insult to
his injury, and fearing no retaliation, secure
of impunity.  For well he knows, that his
body cannot again be reduced to ashes, seeing
that men and women have only two eyes each.[<a id="chap02fn9text"></a><a href="#chap02fn9">9</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
III
</p>

<p>
But in the meanwhile, no sooner had the
King turned his back upon the terrace with
its arbour, than all at once, his feet stopped,
as it were, of their own accord, as if in their
unwillingness to go away, they had suddenly
become rooted in the ground.  And so he
remained standing, with his eyes fixed upon the
ground before him, and a soul, out of which
everything had utterly disappeared, except
the picture of what he had left behind him,
standing on the edge of the cliff.  And he
had totally forgotten Yogeshwara, and the
King's Guru, and everything else, so intense
was his preoccupation and his endeavour
to reconstruct that picture in his mind.  And
as he stood striving to recall it, all unawares
he smiled, so great was his pleasure in its
recollection.[<a id="chap02fn10text"></a><a href="#chap02fn10">10</a>]  And he murmured to himself:
Strange! that I cannot, I know not why,
recollect anything about her, with exact
accuracy, except those delicious, and, somehow
or other, bewildering, and as it were,
provoking brows of hers, with their two
surprising arches.  For I had no time to examine
the rest of her attentively; and moreover, the
blue colour of her eyes, in which I seemed to
flounder, confused my soul, and stood before
it like a mist, in which I could see absolutely
nothing else.  And yet, if I recollect
correctly, the double curve of her brow was as
it were repeated, in her lips, which resembled
a miniature reproduction of her brow, only
red instead of black, and in her soft round
bosom, and even all about her, so that
she seemed to be a thing composed
entirely of twin curves, beginning from her
brow.
</p>

<p>
And so as he stood, all at once there arose
in his soul an intense desire to look at her
again, mixed with extreme regret, and sorrow,
for his own abrupt departure.  And he was
enraged with himself, feeling like one that had
missed an opportunity that could never again
recur, and he stood with a soul sick with
longing to return, and disinclination to go away,
mixed with shame at the thought of returning.
And he muttered to himself: Alas! where
was the necessity of going away with
such extraordinary precipitation?  Why did
I not wait a little while?  Surely I was a
fool.  And what is to be done now?  And
I wonder what she is doing.  Who knows,
whether she is still there, having perhaps gone
away herself, somehow or other, as soon as I
had gone?
</p>

<p>
So as he stood, in perplexity, debating with
himself, all at once, his face lit up, as it were,
with a smile of satisfaction.  And he
exclaimed in delight: Ha!  I have suddenly
discovered a pretext, under cover of which I
can return, and thus create another
opportunity of seeing her, if only she is still
there.
</p>

<p>
And instantly he turned round, and went
back towards the arbour as it were with
joyous step, and a soul in exultation at the
anticipation of seeing her again, mixed with
intense anxiety, lest, when he entered, the
arbour should be empty, and she have gone
away.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
IV
</p>

<p>
And when he entered the arbour once more,
and saw her again, this time, at the very sight
of her, his heart trembled with delight, saying
to itself, as if with relief: Ah! she is still
there.  And she was standing almost exactly
in the attitude in which she stood before, save
only, that she was not quite so close to the
brink of the abyss.  But she made a step
towards it, as he entered, turning, and taking,
as it were, her stand beside it, as much as to
say: Here is my friend, and my defender,
and my refuge.  And all the surprise had
vanished from her face: and instead of it, the
eyes, with which she looked at him in doubt,
were full of dark suspicion and distrust, mixed
with apprehension.  And they watched him,
with close attention, as if she expected that,
like a panther, he might make a sudden spring
upon her, before she could escape.  And she
seemed to say to him, with silent alarm and
indignation: What! has he actually returned?
Ha! it is as I feared.  And now, my only
refuge lies at the very bottom of the gorge.
</p>

<p>
And then, as if afraid lest she should put
her threat into execution, out of terror,
before he could prevent her, the King said
hastily: O mountain maiden, do not be afraid,
to see me return: for I have done so, only
because I was ashamed, first, for having
broken in upon thy privacy, and then again,
still more, for having left thee so abruptly,
without explaining or excusing my intrusion.
And if I am guilty, I am not without
excuse: nor myself the one to blame: since I
was brought here by the minister, Yogeshwara,
who told me to expect in this arbour
the arrival of the Guru of the King.  And
being an utter stranger, I know not, if I go
away alone, whither to turn my steps.  But
in any case, I do adjure thee, to dismiss thy
apprehension: since thou hast absolutely no
occasion at all for alarm.
</p>

<p>
And while he spoke, she stood, listening,
with suspicion, to his apology: and when he
finished, all at once, she turned upon him like
a fury, and exclaimed, stamping her little foot
upon the ground: And how dared Yogeshwara
bring thee to my arbour?  Did I not
refuse, when he begged me to lend it him, and
yet, has he had the audacity to borrow it,
against my will? and use it, as an inn, for
passing strangers?  And as the King stood,
aghast, amazed at the sudden storm of
indignation that fell upon him, like a traveller
overtaken by a thundercloud, yet all the while
wondering at the beauty of the lightning
threatening to strike him, all at once,
recollection suddenly brought into his mind, what
Yogeshwara had said to him, just before he
went away.  And he murmured to himself:
Apparently the owner of this arbour,
notwithstanding Yogeshwara's diligence, is before me
after all, and certainly this arbour is, as it
seems, the very last place to which I should
have come.  And as he thought, all at once
she said to him, with irritation: And who
then art thou, whom he has placed here, as if
on purpose to disturb me, and terrify me and
annoy me?
</p>

<p>
And as the King looked at her, he said to
himself: Now I shall pay for Yogeshwara's
impertinence.  And I feel like a culprit before
her, and yet, somehow or other, her anger
is delightful, like that of a child whose toy
is broken, about to fly into a passion with
anyone it sees.  And he said: O maiden, be
not angry with the innocent.  For I am only
Chand the son of Chand, arrived here this
very morning on a visit of importance to thy
King.
</p>

<p>
And as he spoke, she started with surprise:
and then all at once, as he watched her, all
her anger suddenly disappeared.  And a
smile, like that of one who recollects, crept
over her face: and she dropped all her flowers
upon the floor, and began to clap her hands.
And she exclaimed: Ha! now I remember,
and who else could it be?  And I wonder that
I did not think of it before: since they say,
King Chand is a giant, and thy size is, as
it were, thy guarantee, and the proof of thy
words.  And now, then, I will solve thy
problem, in the matter of this arbour, by instantly
going away myself, and leaving it to thee: to
await by thyself the arrival of the Guru: for
as to Yogeshwara, he shall learn another time,
the danger of employing my arbour as an inn.
</p>

<p>
And instantly, she drew her veil around her
face,[<a id="chap02fn11text"></a><a href="#chap02fn11">11</a>] and came very quickly towards him,
to pass by him, and escape by the door.  But
Chand put out his hand, as though to stop
her, exclaiming: O daughter of King Mitra,
for I cannot doubt that thou art she, I should
be altogether inexcusable, if I came here only
to deprive thee, and as it were, expel thee
from thy arbour by my coming.  See now,
I will myself depart the very moment that
the Guru arrives: and in the meantime, wilt
thou not dismiss thy alarm and indignation,
and suffer me to remain with thee, till he
appears?
</p>

<p>
And as he spoke, Yogeshwara in his
ambush exclaimed in delight: Ha!  I did her
wrong, and she is very clever.  For now she
has brought him to the point of begging for
permission to remain, never dreaming, that that
is exactly what she wishes him to do herself.
And I thought that she had driven him away:
but she, like a skilful angler, knew, that the
hook was already in the jaws of her royal fish.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
V
</p>

<p>
So as the King spoke, with imploring eyes,
and entreaty in his voice, she turned suddenly
towards him, and began as it were to examine
him, with curiosity and amazement.  And
after a while she said, as if with incredulity:
Have my own ears turned traitors, and is it
now, that they are playing me false, or was
it then, when, as I thought, I heard thee name
thyself King Chand the son of Chand?  And
Chand said: Nay, but I am actually he.
And she laughed scornfully, and exclaimed:
Art thou absolutely sure, that thou hast not
mistaken thy identity?  Can it be, that thou
art really Chand?  For I have heard, that of
all companions in the world, women are those
from whom he most desires to escape.
</p>

<p>
And she looked at him awhile, with eyes,
of which he could not tell, whether that which
filled their blue was disbelief or derision or
amusement; and all at once, she turned away,
and went back to her basket, and began once
more to busy herself about its flowers,
kneeling down beside it.  And after a while, she
turned her head towards him, and said,
shooting at him a glance out of the very corner
of her eye: King Chand has my permission,
if he chooses, to remain, till the Guru arrives:
and in the meanwhile, I crave his permission
to return to my work among my flowers, in
which his uninvited entrance interrupted me:
since such a thing as I am is not fit for such
a hero as is he: nor can it be supposed that
conversation such as mine could possibly amuse
him.  And yet, would the King deign to be
advised by such a thing as me, he would go
instantly away, without losing any time: for
there is danger in remaining.
</p>

<p>
And Chand said: Where, and of what
nature is the danger?  And as he spoke, she
turned round, and bent her great blue eyes
upon him, with her two lips closed, as though
determined not to smile, almost into a ball,
so that they exactly resembled a ripe <i>bimba</i>
fruit.  And she seemed as it were to say to
him: Dost thou not recognise, who is the
danger?  And after a while, she turned away,
saying: The danger is, that King Chand
may utterly wreck his reputation for
misogyny, by betraying an inclination for the
society of women.  For I think that his friends
in the plains would be very much astonished;
if they knew that he had actually gone so far
as to return of his own accord to an arbour,
out of which the unsuspected and abominable
presence of one of that insignificant and
useless sex had originally driven him.
</p>

<p>
And then she sat in silence, stealing at him
every now and then glances from eyes he
could not see, that resembled soft flashes of
lightning in the form of blue and silent
laughter, from under the long lashes which
as he watched her he could see standing out
from her round soft cheek like the roof of
a house.  And though she never laughed, he
knew that she was laughing at him, by that
very cheek, from which he could not take
his eyes, resembling as it did a very
incarnation of round, soft, delicious, unpunishable
impertinence, that attracted him with so
irresistible a longing for its owner that he could
hardly breathe.  And yet he was filled with
shame, and confusion, and rage against
himself, and also against her; and all the while
he felt, that his anger against her was as it
were impotent and helpless, for his soul began
as it were to turn traitor to him, going over
in spite of himself to her side.  And so he
stood, gazing at her in wrath that was mixed
with a smile of delight, utterly unable either
to say or to do anything at all.  And he
strove to be offended with her, in vain, in
spite of the shame and exasperation that she
was pouring into his heart.  And so as he
stood, like a picture of wounded pride and
helpless irresolution, all at once, she looked
round, and as it were caught him unawares,
standing at her mercy, abashed and ashamed,
the very target of her mocking eyes.  And
utterly unable to endure it any longer, he
suddenly turned and ran out of the arbour, as
if he were escaping from a foe.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
VI
</p>

<p>
And then, strange! hardly had he gone a
few steps from the terrace, when again his
feet stopped, as if utterly refusing to carry
him away.  And he stood, burning with shame,
and anger, and yet unable to move.  And he
thought no longer, as at first, of her beauty,
but simply of herself: and he was absolutely
miserable, feeling that somehow or other she
had mastered him; and his soul was filled to
the very brim with nothing but her, and as
it were kept on repeating obstinately, she, she,
she, as if her personality had filled it to the
exclusion of his own.  Alas! by reason of his
youth and inexperience he was all unaware,
that the poison of Love was in his heart, and
beginning to work.  And she danced as it
were before his eyes, and whirled all round
him, and sat in his soul, and seized upon it
and its faculties and senses, and it was as
though the world had vanished, leaving in its
place nothing but a void, composed of a blue
that was the very substance of herself.  And
so he stood, still, like one torn by strong chains
in opposite directions, determined to go away,
and yet never moving, and ashamed to go
back, and yet drawn by an irresistible spell,
that whispered as it were in his ear: Return:
return.  And so he stood a long while, as
utterly unconscious of everything around him,
as if he had become a tree, fanned by the wind.
</p>

<p>
And at last, he turned, and went back, very
slowly, with sad and heavy feet, that moved,
as if they were carrying a guilty criminal to
his own execution.  And when he reached the
arbour door, again he stopped, and stood
irresolutely near it, looking out over the valley,
like one paralysed by his own indecision.  And
then at length, unable to endure the separation
from her any longer, he said to himself with
a sigh: Now everything is quiet: and doubtless,
she has utterly forgotten all about me,
thinking me gone, not again to return.  And
now no doubt she will be working with her
flowers, just as she was at first, and with her
back towards me.  Therefore, if I stoop down,
very carefully, making no noise, I shall be
able to watch her, unobserved.  And he
stooped, stealthily, and peeped round the
edge of the door.
</p>

<p>
And lo! when he looked, she also was standing,
stooping, almost exactly like himself, on
the other side, close to the door, and leaning
forward eagerly, with a great bunch of flowers
in one hand, and the other stretched, like a
creeper, bowing in the wind of excitement,
a little way before her, watching, as if with
eager desire, to see him return.  And when,
all at once, their eyes met, she stood a little
while looking at him exactly like a child in
the extremity of delight.  And all at once,
she began to laugh, with low, long, joyous
and unrestrainable laughter, that went on and
on, sounding in his ears like the murmur of
a waterfall, and seeming as though it would
never stop.  And the King, reduced as he
was to the very lowest depth of utter shame,
and blushing, till the very hair seemed to stand
up upon his head, found as it were a refuge
in his very desperation.  And he said to
himself: I care not, for now I am at
the very bottom of the abyss of shame:
and let her laugh, if she will, at me, or
anything in the three worlds: so only that
I listen to her, and am here, to look at her
again.
</p>

<p>
And at last, she said, with her laughter still
hanging as it were in the music of her voice:
O King Chand, if thou art really he, come
in, since as it appears, thou absolutely must,
for I have a question to put to thee.  And
the King entered, like a culprit, and stood
looking at her like one ready to submit to
any punishment she chose.  And she came
towards him and stood, with her two little bare
feet exactly together, side by side, and her
two hands clasped behind her back, and her
head thrown right back upon her shoulders to
look up at him, so that her two small breasts
jutted out like round bosses on the edge of
the delicious terrace of her throat.  And she
said: Maháráj, wilt thou, to whom all women
are equally contemptible, only tell me, for I
am curious to know, why thou art so utterly
unable to go away from this arbour of mine?
Is it these flowers that attract thee?  For here
there is absolutely nothing other than these
flowers, and myself.
</p>

<p>
And as she spoke, her small mouth, that
resembled the incarnate fragrance and colour
of a flower, with its two intoxicating lips
parted in the curl of a smile, just over the
leaf-like point of her small soft chin,
bewildered him so, that he could hardly listen
to the meaning of her words.  And he
stammered, and hesitated, and said: I came,
because I had nowhere else to go.  Then she
said: And why, then, didst thou go away at
all?  And suddenly he said: I went, in order
to escape, alas! from thee.  And she said,
shaking her head slowly from side to side:
Nay, not from me, but it may be, from
thyself.  Art thou sure that it is not thy own
self, from which thou art vainly endeavouring
to escape?  Dost thou know thyself so well,
as to be certain what it is, that thou art
shunning or desiring?  Stand, now, there a little
while, and examine for thyself thy condition,
while I finish my work.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
VII
</p>

<p>
And as she spoke, once more she went back
to her flowers.  And she dragged her great
basket, with difficulty, to the very edge of the
cliff, and knelt, sitting on her own feet,
beside it.  And taking out its flowers, one by
one, she began rapidly and skilfully to weave
them in a garland, crooning to herself all the
while a kind of song, in a voice so low as to
be all but inaudible.  And she paid absolutely
no attention to the King at all, wholly
absorbed as it seemed in her work, and ignoring
his presence altogether.  And every now and
then, she took a flower, and held it up before
her, speaking as it were to it, before she wove
it in among its fellows; and now and then
she looked, with attention, at a flower, and as
if condemning it, threw it away into the
valley.  So she continued, weaving, and
muttering as it were a spell.  And all the while
she swayed to and fro, a very little, as if
keeping time to her own unintelligible song.
</p>

<p>
And so as she sat and wove, the King stood
watching her, leaning against the door-post,
with his arms folded, absolutely still.  And he
resembled a rock, against which the sea of her
beauty came beating, wave after wave, as if
to shake it from its base.  And his soul went
travelling, by the means of his eye, slowly and
carefully about her, like a painter.  And like
a bee, it hovered about the flower of her
moving lips, and flew circling all about the slowly
moving curve of her bosom, and wandered in
and out about her slender waist, lost, as she
sat kneeling, in the folds of her heavy limbs,
and then rose and repeated its journey,
ending where it first began, and going round and
round her, as if unable to go away.  And as
he gazed, he became as it were himself a sea,
and began as it were to surge in agitation,
under the soft mysterious attraction of that
moonlike mass of grace and symmetry and
curve and colour, floating as it seemed before
him in the air, on the edge of that cliff.  And
all the while, there was silence in the arbour,
broken only by the low sound of the singing
of the King's daughter.  And in that silence,
the humming of the bees outside came, every
now and then, drifting in upon the breeze,
that carried also the scent of the blossoms of
the trees, and floated about the King, charming
at once by a double spell, like billows of
the essence of intoxication rolling in on his
already intoxicated soul.  And he heard the
wind below in the valley sweep sighing among
its trees, and now and then, the note of the
wild pigeon calling to his wife.  So he stood,
wrapped in a dream, lifted as it were on that
cloud-loved terrace above the world, and
bathing in the nectar-poison of the nervous
apprehension of pure passion that was absolutely
lost, in the ecstasy of self-annihilation, in its
object, the maiden form before him, singing
and swaying as she wove.
</p>

<p>
And then, at last, she finished her work,
and stopped.  And she stood up, and took
the garland she had made, and laid it carefully
aside, in a corner.  And then she turned
towards him, and pointed with her finger to
the marble seat that ran like a long bench
all along the arbour wall.  And the King
instantly went and took his seat, as if
obeying her commands, upon it, while she returned
and remained, half sitting, half kneeling,
beside her basket with fragments of flowers all
around her, and her two hands joined together
on her lap.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
VIII
</p>

<p>
And at that moment, there came a great
eagle, that passed in the air close beside them,
and flew away over the valley.  And seeing
him, she said: O King Chand, would thy
friends below believe him, were he to fly down
and tell them, he had seen thee sitting on a
mountain cliff, conversing with a woman!
Then said Chand with a sigh: Art thou
indeed a woman, and not rather some mountain
witch that has destroyed me by a spell?
For it is but a moment since first I entered
this enchanted arbour, and already I am
changed, into something other than I was:
and short as it has been, yet that moment has
contained within it as it were the power of
years of alteration.  Then she said: If this
arbour of mine has wrought a change in thee,
to thy dissatisfaction, surely the fault was all
thy own, for coming in, and thrusting thyself
upon me, as it were, not once alone, but many
times, not by my invitation, but of thy own
accord.  Blame, therefore, thyself alone, if
thou hast suffered, by reason of thy intrusion,
a change for the worse.  And the King said
hastily: I said not that the change was for
the worse, but only, that I had undergone a
change.  Then she said: But if, then, thy
change is for the better, of what art thou
complaining?  Surely thou art in that case a
gainer, by me and by my arbour.  And he
said: Nay, neither did I say that the change
was for the better.  And she laughed, and
exclaimed: What! canst thou not even tell,
whether this extraordinary change that has
befallen thee is good or bad?  Dost thou,
then, not even know, which to prefer, thy
former condition, or thy present?  And he
said: No.  Then she said: Of what nature,
then, is this inexplicable change, that leaves
thee neither better, nor worse, nor even yet
the same, but something indeterminate, of
which thou canst give no account at all?
And the King remained silent, with his eyes
fixed upon her face.
</p>

<p>
So then, after a while, she said softly:
Come now, shall I come to thy assistance, and
like a physician, probe for thee thy soul, and
show thee, what thou canst not unriddle for
thyself?  Art thou not angry with thyself,
and only for this reason, that thou art
beginning to doubt, whether, after all, a woman is
exactly only what thou hast hitherto determined
to consider her?  Say, is it not so?  And thy
confidence in thyself wavers, and thy soul is
endeavouring to make, if possible, someone
else, rather than thyself, culpable for the
wound given to thy vanity?  And the King
exclaimed, as if stung by her words: Did I
not say, thou wert a witch?  Then she said:
What need is here of any witchcraft?  Art
thou not, by thine own avowal, Chand, and
who is there that has not heard alike of
Chand's delight in war, and his antipathy to
my sex?  And she paused a moment, and she
said: Come now; since fortune and thy own
insistence have cast thee for a moment in my
way, and this Guru seems long in making
his appearance, shall I in the interval do
battle against thee, for myself and for my
sisters?  Thou art fond of battles: art thou
ready to try thy fortune in this field?
</p>

<p>
And the King said in confusion: Nay, for
the combatants in this case are unevenly
equipped.
</p>

<p>
Then she laughed ironically, and exclaimed:
What!  Chand! and afraid of a combat with
a woman!  Shall I compare thee, then, to a
general who has long ago taken up a position
of which he boasts loudly as impregnable, yet
dare not expose it to the test?  And all at
once she leaned towards him, and said, with
a smile, in a tone of irresistible sweetness:
Come, bring thy charges against me, one by
one, and I will do what I can, in my
weakness,[<a id="chap02fn12text"></a><a href="#chap02fn12">12</a>] to refuse and repel them.
</p>

<p>
And as she spoke, Yogeshwara said to himself,
within his ambush: Ha! now, let us see
what he will say.  And well did he object,
that the combat was uneven, and its result,
a foregone conclusion.  For this crafty little
daughter of a King knows just as well as he
does, that she is herself the formidable
argument, against which he has not only no
weapons of attack, but absolutely no defence
at all.  And even before the battle has begun,
she has annihilated all his force beforehand,
by that bewildering glance from those blue
irrefutable eyes, which stealing into his heart,
have bribed and corrupted it, making it her
own ally, and a traitor to himself.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
IX
</p>

<p>
So, then, as she leaned towards him, with
her head a little on one side, and her neck a
little curved, and her eyes a little closed, and
her lips a little parted in a caressing smile,
the appeal of her soft entreating beauty
struck the King so hard, that in his agitation,
his tongue refused to speak.  And just as if
it had heard what Yogeshwara had said, his
heart, drawn towards her through his eyes,
deserted him, and going over to the enemy,
nestled like a fugitive bird in the little hollow
between the twin wave of her breast, saying
as it were: Here will I dwell, close to her
own, rocked to sleep on the rise and fall of
this gentle sea.  And he looked at her in
silence, overcome with his own emotion, and
at last he said with difficulty: Did I not say
that I was changed?  For but a little while
ago, before I entered this magic arbour, my
mind was made completely up, with reference
to thy sex, and I could have told thee I know
not how many unanswerable reasons for
condemning it: but now my soul is in confusion,
and as I look at thee, I cannot bring against
it any arguments at all.  Aye! who could
bring a charge of any kind against such a
thing as thee?
</p>

<p>
And as he sighed, she said, with gaiety:
Ha! does the enemy surrender, before even
so much as attempting an attack?  And what
can have been the strength of a fortress, which
its garrison abandons at the very sign of
danger?
</p>

<p>
But the King, for answer, leaned his chin
upon his hand, that rested on his knee, and
gazed at her in silence, for so long, that the
smile died away upon her lips, and she dropped
her eyes upon the ground.  And all at once
he said: As I look at thee, my weapons of
arguments seem as it were to bend and
become blunted, and even to crumble to pieces
in my hand: and I resemble one in a dream,
fighting in vain with a phantom sword, that
turns to water or disappears whenever he
attempts to strike a blow.  For I used to think,
that women were weak, and worthless in the
day of battle, and so it is: and yet, looking
at thee, weak as thou art, for I could crush
thee in a moment, I would not have thee other
than just the thing thou art, and thy very
weakness seems, I know not how, to be a merit
and a virtue in thee, and stronger than my
strength; and in thy case, the very notion of
a battle seems utterly abominable, and
ludicrous, and out of place.  And again, I used
to think that a woman was a burden, and as
I look at thee, I think that thou art a burden
I would willingly carry, for as long as my
strength would endure.  And women's voices
seemed to me made only for chattering and
scolding, but thine is a music, strange, and
soft, and unimaginably beautiful, that plays
upon my heart, and gladly would I listen to
it for ever, never so much as noting the
passage of any time.  And but yesterday I would
have told thee, a woman was a traitor, but
to-day, looking at thy soul in the colour of
thine eyes, I doubt not women, but myself.
For they seem to me like two great black
tanks, filled with unearthly liquid drawn from
some deep Pátála well, where ocean mixes
with the azure of the skies.  And but an hour
ago, I would have told thee, a woman was
an ugly little thing, a deformity of man, in
every point inferior to him: but as I look at
thee, remorse comes over me, and horror, as I
recollect and shudder at my crime, and I see
that I resemble one blaspheming a divinity
that ought rather to be worshipped and adored.
For I am but a clod, and a coarse and rough
and rude misshapen lump, compared with thee,
and every morsel of thy fairy figure, from thy
masses of dark hair to the sole of thy little
foot, fills me with agitation and feeling that
I cannot utter, and fierce desire as it were to
devour thee, and thirst to drink of thy
unutterable loveliness, that increases as I watch
thee till I am likely to die of its intolerable
sting.  For I am burning as if with fire, and
I know not what to do.  And but an hour
ago, I thought my soul a strong tower, but
as I look at thee, struck by a stroke of
lightning in the form of thy little figure, it has
all tumbled to pieces, and lies in black
miserable ruin at thy feet.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">

</p>

<p>
And the King's voice trembled a little, as
he spoke: and when he ended, she remained
silent a little while, while the colour came and
went upon her cheek.  And at last, she
laughed a little laugh, and she looked, not at
him, but away into the valley, as she said:
Nay, but this is a thing altogether incredible
and strange.  For King Chand, instead of
attacking women, has suddenly become, on the
contrary, their partisan.  And yet I think,
that his partisanship is greatly to be
distrusted, even more than his old uncompromising
enmity.  For just as formerly he utterly
despised and denounced all women without
exception, never having had anything to do
with even one: so now he suddenly becomes
their champion, on the evidence of only a
single instance, seen only for a single instant.
And so his new opinions seem even more
suspicious, and will probably be still more
rapidly evanescent, than his old.
</p>

<p>
And Chand said hastily: I swear to thee,
that my mind is made up on this matter for
ever, never again to waver, even for an
instant.  Thou art&mdash;&mdash;But she interrupted him,
holding up at him her forefinger, with a
smile.  And she exclaimed: O King, is it
good policy, in matters of war, for a warrior
to stake his life on so momentary a glimpse
of his enemy?  Stay, was that a footstep that
I heard?  And she listened for a moment,
bending round in an attitude that almost
broke the King's heart as he watched her,
exclaiming within himself: O that the King's
Guru were only at the bottom of the sea!
</p>

<p>
And hearing absolutely nothing, but the
sighing of the wind, after a while, she turned
once more towards the King, and she said,
playfully: Must I, then, remind thee, that
all this while, thou art merely an Intruder,
present only by my sufferance and
condescension, and that though it has come about,
I know not how, that thou art actually sitting
here talking to me, in an arbour where no
other has ever come but me, yet, that should
the Intruder become forgetful of his true
position, he will be immediately expelled?
</p>

<p>
And hearing her speak, Yogeshwara in his
ambush exclaimed within himself: Ha! wonderful
beyond imagination is the craft of
women, and above all, of the one before me!
For now, so far is he from dreaming that
he was brought here expressly for her
purpose, that she has convinced him that he is
an interloper, indebted to her grace, and she
has even filled him with the nectar of unutterable
delight, by allowing him to suppose that
she permits him to remain!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
XI
</p>

<p>
But in the meanwhile, the King exclaimed
piteously: O daughter of King Mitra, well
indeed I know, that I am only an intruder:
out upon me, if I was tempted to forget it,
even for a moment!  And yet I was not
without excuse, for how could I remember
anything whatever, with a mind bewildered by the
colour of thy great eyes?  But now, I will
swear to keep myself within any bound or
limit that thou choosest to impose, so only
that thou dost not bid me go away.  For
then I could not answer for myself, and sorely
indeed should I be tempted to disobey thee,
though I long for nothing so much, as to obey
any orders whatever, so only that they are
thine.
</p>

<p>
And she said: On these terms, I will allow
thee to remain: though, should I perceive any
symptom of disobedience, I shall immediately
go away myself: as in any case, I must do,
as soon as the Guru has arrived.
</p>

<p>
And the King said, carelessly: There is
no longer need for any Guru, for I have
altogether changed my mind, on the matter
which he was commissioned to discuss.
</p>

<p>
And then, she laughed joyfully, and
exclaimed: Aha!  O King, much I fear, that
thou, who but an hour ago, wast ready to
bring charges of lightness and frivolity against
every member of my sex, art thyself more
changeful and inconstant than any woman of
us all.  For here art thou, changing thy mind
once more, no longer about women and their
crimes, but even about matters of state-policy,
and all in but a moment.  Art thou not
ashamed of thyself, and in presence of a
woman?  And the King said: O thou beautiful
and tormenting being, I am not in the
least ashamed: for it is all thy fault, and thy
doing, and thou art the cause of all.  And
now I wish from the very bottom of my heart,
that thou wert thyself the Guru.  For I wish
to transact no business of any kind, except
with thee: and moreover, the concern is far
less, in this matter, with the Guru than with
thee.
</p>

<p>
And she thought for a moment, and she
said: And what if I were actually the Guru?
What then?  Come, what can be so easy as
to gratify thy wish?  Shall we, like children,
make believe?  Suppose me, if thou canst, to
be the Guru, and tell me, what is thy business
of State.
</p>

<p>
And she changed, all at once, her position,
and sat, as though upon the carpet of a
Durbar, cross-legged, assuming an air of
dignity, with mock solemnity, as if preparing to
listen with profound attention to what he was
about to say.  And as he watched her, the
heart of Yogeshwara in his ambush almost
burst within him, and he exclaimed within
himself: Ha!  Surely I am a baby, in
matters of diplomacy, compared with this
extraordinary woman!  For she has reached, at a
single bound, the very object of her meeting,
and has actually presented herself to him, in
her true capacity, spreading open, as it were,
the very truth naked before his eyes, without
his so much as suspecting anything at all!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
XII
</p>

<p>
But in the meanwhile, the King gazed at
her, intoxicated with admiration and delight.
And he murmured to himself: Where has the
woman gone, of whom, at first, I think, I was
actually afraid?  For now she has turned, so
to speak, into a child, playing at a game.
And all at once, he began to tremble.  For
like a flash of lightning, the dark ocean of
love-rapture in which he was plunged
suddenly became illuminated with a ray of
sunlight in the form of hope, so that he said to
himself: Am I mistaken, or is she a little
kinder than she was?  And all at once, a
thought came into his heart.  And he leaned
towards her, and said: Dear little Guru, thou
art new to state-affairs, of which the first
axiom is this, that the discussion of matters
of importance demands above all things
absolute secrecy, and freedom from interruption.
Is there no attendant of thine somewhere
within call, whom we might summon, and bid
him tell the true Guru, that he is not required,
until our deliberation is concluded?
</p>

<p>
And hearing him speak, the King's daughter
broke into a peal of laughter.  And suddenly
abandoning all her dignity, she began to clap
her hands in delight, looking at him joyously,
as if she were really nothing but a child.  And
she exclaimed: Ah! thou art crafty, and
cunning indeed.  Ah! that would indeed be a
stroke of policy, to oust the true Guru in
favour of the sham.  But, O King Chand, I
fear that it cannot be.  Thou must resign
thyself to making the best of the time still at
thy disposal, afforded thee by his delay.
Therefore lay thy matter very quickly before
me, for due consideration.
</p>

<p>
And the King said: O most reverend
Guru, I came here to deliberate on certain
preliminary difficulties, in the matter of thy
father's submission to myself.  For he is, of
all the kings, the only one that has not yet
submitted.  Then she said: But what if he
should refuse?  Then said Chand: He will
not refuse, for if he did, I should compel him,
by force.  And he will never bring the matter
to that test, for well he knows, that my
strength is a hundred times greater than his
own.  Aye! had he dreamed of resistance, I
should have been delighted: and we should
long ago have swept him away, as an angry
river does a blade of straw.
</p>

<p>
And she looked furtively at him as he spoke,
saying to herself: Now he is himself, no
longer like a bashful lover, but resembling
that great copper-coloured eagle that recently
swept by us as it searched for prey.  And as
he thinks of a battle, he has for the moment
forgotten all about me, proud, and confident
of his own strength.  And then, as the King
looked at her, she placed her finger on the
very point of her chin, and said: O King,
this is a matter requiring for its settlement
age, and experience, and policy of the very
deepest kind.  And therefore the King my
master entrusted it to me, as being, in all his
dominions, the oldest and most crafty of his
advisers.
</p>

<p>
And she looked at the King with a smile,
while Yogeshwara in his ambush laughed to
himself for joy: saying to himself: She is
utterly deceiving him, by telling him the very
truth.  But the King said: O wrinkled,
grey-haired Guru, sure I am, that the King
thy master could not possibly have entrusted
the matter to a more irresistible negotiator
than thyself, whose years are a guarantee for
thy incomparable dexterity.  Then she said,
looking at him with large eyes full of grave
reproof: Such compliments are, we know,
the indispensable preliminary in all negotiations,
meaning, as their employers know well,
absolutely nothing at all.  And the King
said: Dear Guru, thou art altogether
mistaken.  For I do not speak by proxy, but
am my own ambassador, and therefore
empower myself to say exactly what I mean, as
in this instance.  Then she said: Let us pass
over all preliminaries, and come to the
business in hand.  Can we not offer inducements
to the enemy, whom we are not strong enough
to meet in the field, to come to terms?  And
the King said eagerly: Aye! that you can.
For often, on the very eve of battle, timely
alliances and bribes have warded off disaster;
and for this very purpose it was, that, as I
think, kings' daughters were invented by the
Creator.  For many times, the gift of a
daughter has turned an enemy into a friend.
Then she said: Ah! but in this case, such an
expedient is altogether futile, and out of the
question.  For King Chand is known to be
an enemy of women, and kings' daughters
are, after all, only women, and therefore less
than nothing, and of no value in his eyes.
And the King said hastily: Sweet Guru, thy
spies have misinformed thee, and led thee
astray.  For I can positively assure thee that
circumstances of very recent occurrence have
so altered the complexion of King Chand's
opinions, that the offer of a daughter by King
Mitra would certainly render all submission
entirely superfluous.  Go back and tell thy
master, that King Chand would infinitely
prefer his daughter to his submission, or
anything whatever in the world.
</p>

<p>
And she looked at him, gravely shaking at
him her pretty head, and she said, with
indecision in her voice: O Intruder, remember! and
beware!  It is time now, to bring this
game to a conclusion.  For what is it, after
all, but child's-play?  And it is even more
than time for the true Guru to appear.  And
the King exclaimed: Nay, dearest Guru, not
so.  For I swear to thee, that though the
game might be a game, my terms are no jest.
And she said: Then, as Guru, I reply: Who
shall convince King Mitra, and still more, his
daughter, that King Chand has changed his
mind?  For in love, as in war, promises may
be deception, and oaths but a snare.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
XIII
</p>

<p>
And then, as Chand suddenly rose to his
feet, and stood up, she also started up,
exclaiming: O King, stand still now, for a
little while, and listen to me.  And as she
stood, with each hand firmly clenched beside
her, and her head thrown back upon her
shoulders, she resembled a picture of
determination.  And she turned just a little paler,
and her eyes grew just a little darker, as she
fixed her glance upon the King.  And Yogeshwara,
as he watched her from his ambush, said
with anxiety to himself: What in the world
is she going to do now?  For she has
completely gained her end, and brought the
negotiation to a successful issue; and now all she
has to do is, to break off the interview and
go away: and everything will settle of its own
accord for our advantage.  Can it be, that
having hitherto played her part with the most
consummate skill, she is just about to spoil
all by some false step, or, that as her sex gave
her victory, so now it is going to tempt her
into losing all gained, by some unhappy
blunder, springing from feminine caprice?
Or does she, for all her cleverness, not yet
understand, that the essence of all wisdom
lies in knowing where to stop?
</p>

<p>
So then, as Chand watched her, also with
anxiety, all unaware of what was passing in
her mind, she said: O King Chand, it may
very well be, that should you make your
proposal to the King my father, he will accept
it, to secure his own advantage.  For many
times a daughter has been sacrificed, to save
a State; tossed like a ball backwards and
forwards from hand to hand, and like a bag of
money, changing owners in the market, with
no voice in the matter of its own.  But now
there is another person to be considered.  For
since the beginning, it has been the privilege
of all kings' daughters to choose their
husbands for themselves.[<a id="chap02fn13text"></a><a href="#chap02fn13">13</a>]  And though my
father may be willing, and even all too
willing, to close with your offer, and hand me
over like a cow to the best bidder, perhaps
I may not be equally pleased with the bargain
myself.  And what guarantee canst thou give
me, that I shall not be a loser in the matter,
and a victim, and a dupe?
</p>

<p>
And as she spoke, she fixed her eyes sternly
on the King, as though to search him, with
penetrating interrogation in their glance.
And the King said sorrowfully: Alas! dear
Guru, what can I say to thee to convince thee
of my sincerity?  And she said, with energy:
Nay, in this matter, I am no Guru, but like
thee, my own ambassador.  And what hast
thou to say, then, for thyself?  Thou art a
known enemy of women.  And hast thou,
then, any ground for thy dislike?  Hast thou
bought thy bad wisdom in the market of
experience, and drawn thy bad opinion of my
sex from association with evil specimens of
womankind?  And as she spoke, she shot at
him a glance that resembled a flash of dark
lightning in the form of suspicion, and
entered his soul like a sword.  And the King
said earnestly: May I never see thee again,
if I have any such experience at all: for I
do assure thee, that I have hardly ever seen,
much less spoken to, any woman but thyself.
</p>

<p>
And as he stood, with his hand stretched
towards her, and timidity mixed with entreaty
in his eyes, she plunged into them her own,
as if endeavouring to read to the very bottom
of his heart.  And all at once, she sighed a
little sigh, as if with unutterable relief.  And
she sank back, changing suddenly all over as
it were from the hardest stone into a substance
softer than the foam of the sea.  And her
clenched hands relaxed, opening like flowers,
and the cloud vanished from her face, and
there came into her eyes a smile that ran as
it were like sunshine over her whole body.
And she exclaimed: Why, then, thou art
altogether fraudulent.  And pray, by what
authority didst thou dare to assume, like a severe
judge, the right of condemning all women in
the lump, never having had anything to do
with them?  And the King said: I learned
my lesson from my father, and with him was
my whole life passed, in camps, and battlefields,
and the chase of wild beasts.  Then she
said: Thou hast indeed something in thee of
the wild animals amongst which thou hast
lived, and art in sore need of training in
gentler arts.  And could I but consider thee
a true diamond, I have half a mind to be thy
polisher, myself.
</p>

<p>
And she looked at the King with eyes, in
which the sweetness was within a very little
of affection.  And instantly, fire leaped from
the King's heart, and ran like a flame all
through him.  And he exclaimed: Ah! with
thee for my teacher, I would very quickly learn
anything whatever.  Then she said: Go back,
O Intruder, to thy seat: for it is not good
for the pupil to be in too great a proximity
to his Guru:[<a id="chap02fn14text"></a><a href="#chap02fn14">14</a>] and I will give thee thy first
lesson.
</p>

<p>
And as the King returned joyously to his
seat, she took her flower basket, and turning
it over, emptied all its remaining flowers upon
the floor.  And choosing one from among
them, she placed the basket, upside down, a
little way from the King, and seated herself
upon it, with the flower in her hand.  And
she said: Now the judge is on the seat of
judgment, to try thee.  And yonder is my
garland, and now it is to be determined,
whether thou art worthy to have it placed
about thy neck,[<a id="chap02fn15text"></a><a href="#chap02fn15">15</a>] or not.
</p>

<p>
And Yogeshwara in his ambush said softly
to himself: Now she is playing with him,
after the manner of her sex.  And who knows,
whether it has not come about, that the biter
has been bit, and the snarer taken in the snare,
and she has partly fallen in love with him
herself: as well she might.  For love is
dangerous, and double-edged, and catching, like
a fever, and it will be long before she sees
another, better fitted than this young lion's
cub, to touch her heart.  And she looks at him
now, not as she did before, but as if she were
beginning to wish to coax him, and to tease
him, and to play the tyrant over him, as much
as he wishes it himself.  For the longing that
stretches, as it were, imploring hands towards
her, out of his intoxicated eyes, resembles a
whirlpool, out of which she may not find it
easy, and perhaps does not even desire, to
escape.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
XIV
</p>

<p>
So she sat awhile, looking at him with
mischief in her laughing eyes, at which he gazed
with senses that began to leave him out of
joy.  And all at once, she held up before him
the lily in her hand.  And she said: Dost
thou recognise this flower?  And the King
looked at it carefully, bending forward half
to see it, half in order to get closer to the
hand that held it up.  And he said: No: it
is a flower of a kind very singular indeed, and
of strange beauty, that I have never seen
before.  Then she said: It is my flower, chosen
by me, and preferred to all the others, to be
mine, and like myself, a native of the hills.
And if ever, in any former birth, I was
myself a flower, beyond a doubt, I was this: for
as I see it, when I wander in the forest, I
am drawn as it were towards it, whether I
will or no, and it speaks to me, in its
language, of a long forgotten state when we were
one.  And now, canst thou employ it in battle
as a sword?  And yet, for all that, is it good
for nothing?  Then he said: O Guru, I see
thy meaning and thy malice.  It would
indeed be a folly and a sin, to employ the
sweet flower as a sword.  And were it mine,
I would place it in a shrine, and worship it
as it deserves, since it exactly resembles the
hood of the snake that overshadows Maheshwara,
save only that it is white.[<a id="chap02fn16text"></a><a href="#chap02fn16">16</a>]  And now,
since it is thy flower, it shall also be mine.
Then she said: But as yet it is not thine.  And
whether I give it thee, or not, depends on
my decision in thy case.  And I incline to
think, not.  For it is but an hour, since thou
wert ready to condemn all flowers whatever
as things of naught, only because the poor
flowers were not swords.  And the King said:
Dear Guru, be not hasty and unjust.  Could
he be blamed for not appreciating flowers
that had never seen one in his life?  Then
she said: And what, then, had he seen one,
and only one?  Much I fear, lest, once
having experienced the sweetness of one flower,
he might be tempted to run riot among them all.
</p>

<p>
And the King said, with emphasis: Guru,
thy fear is vain, and void of substance, and
like my own antipathy before.
</p>

<p>
And she stooped, and picked up at random
another flower from the floor.  And she said:
See! is not this one just as beautiful and
tempting as the first?  But the King put up
his hands before his eyes, exclaiming: I will
not even look at it at all.  Then she said,
softly: Who will believe the bee, that swore
a deadly feud against all flowers, now
swearing to confine himself to one?  Are not all
bees naturally rovers, and hard to satiate,
such is their appetite for variety?  And he
said: I know nothing of the bees, but this
I know, that for myself, I want no flower
but one.  Then she said: And for how long?
And he said: For a <i>yuga</i>.  And she
exclaimed: What! only a single <i>yuga</i>?[<a id="chap02fn17text"></a><a href="#chap02fn17">17</a>]  And
he said: A <i>kalpa</i>.  And she said: Thy desire
for the flower has then, after all, a limit, if
a long one?  And the King said: Multiply
<i>yuga</i> by <i>yuga</i>, and <i>kalpa by kalpa</i>, it is the
same.
</p>

<p>
And she said: And what, during all these
<i>yugas</i> and <i>kalpas</i>, wouldst thou be doing with
thy flower?  And he said: Nay, I will show
thee, then, when it is mine.  Of what use are
the words of one unworthy of belief?
</p>

<p>
And she waited for a while, with a hesitation
compounded half of indecision, half of the wish
to keep him in suspense.  And then all at
once she laughed, and blushed, and threw the
flower towards him, saying: Come, I will try
thee, for a single <i>yuga</i>.  And if, at its end,
my flower is still with thee, who knows what
I may give thee in the next?
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
XV
</p>

<p>
And then, as the King seized the flower with
avidity, and put it to his lips, looking at her
with longing eyes, she looked back at him for
a single instant with the shadow of a smile
trembling on the very corner of her lips: and
then all at once, it vanished, and she dropped
her eyes, and just a very little colour came
into her cheek.  And so, for a while, they
remained silent; she with her eyes fixed upon
the ground, and he with his own fastened
upon her face.  And there was dead silence
in that arbour, just as if nobody was there.
Only the humming of the bees seemed as it
were to murmur to them, like the echo of their
own thoughts, which neither dared to speak.
And the wind sighed in the valley, and died
away, leaving behind it a silence greater than
before, in which they heard nothing but the
beating of their own hearts.
</p>

<p>
And all at once, she rose abruptly from her
basket, as if half-frightened at the very
silence, and moved away, a little way, towards
the edge of the abyss.  And at that moment,
the King suddenly struck his hand upon his
knee.  And he exclaimed, Ha! so vehemently,
that she started, and turned and stood, looking
at him, in alarm.  And she said, in a voice
that faltered with timidity: What is the
matter?  And the King exclaimed: Alas! dearest
Guru, I have frightened thee.  And
yet I think, that I shall frighten thee again,
as often as I can, so much does thy fear
become thee.  Then she said: But what caused
thee to exclaim?  And he said: I have made
a discovery.  Then she said, with a smile:
And what hast thou discovered?  And the
King said: Alas! now all thy beautiful
timidity has flown away.  And with reason:
for thou hast little indeed to fear, so long as I
am near thee.  Aye! woe to whatever threatens
thee, while I am by thy side!  But as to my
discovery, it is, that thou art an impostor and
a cheat.
</p>

<p>
And she looked at him, fixedly, turning just
a little paler: and she said: I do not
understand.  Then he said: Here all this while, I
have been before thee like a culprit, rated by
thee for my opinion of thy sex: and reduced
to utter shame before thee, falsely representing
thyself to be a woman.  And as I looked
at thee, all at once, like a sudden flash of
lightning, the truth appeared: and now I
know thee to be a rogue, and a cheat, and
not a woman after all.  And now I am
redeemed, in my own eyes, and feel no longer
any shame at being drawn against my will
to one who has absolutely no claim to be
classed among the sex.
</p>

<p>
And she laughed, as if with relief; and she
said: What, then, am I, if not a woman?
And the King said: How can I tell?  But
doubtless thou art some mountain incarnation
of loveliness and fascination, distinct and
altogether different from the race of men and
women, and peculiar to thyself.  And now I
have a great mind to punish thee for thy
villainy, in falsely playing the woman for my
confusion.
</p>

<p>
And she laughed again, softly, and said:
What wilt thou do to me, to punish me, for
I am at thy mercy?  And the King said:
Thou speakest truly: for see!  I could crush
thee to pieces with this hand, or throw thee
from the cliff.  And yet, that were indeed a
sin, and I should resemble one placing his heel
upon a flower.  Nay, but I will presently go
to thy father, and bid him cast thee into
prison, for luring to destruction strangers that
come by invitation to his capital, against his
own safe-conduct.  And now I am sorely
tempted to look upon thee as a Yakshi, or
a Rákshasi, devouring human bodies, and
doubtless, Yogeshwara is thy agent, who
draws travellers to thy den, and I myself thy
victim, only the last of many, whose bones it
may be lie scattered at the foot of yonder cliff.
And Yogeshwara said, within his ambush:
Now, without knowing it, he is getting very

undesignedly, will touch her to the quick.

<p>
And she was silent for a while, and then
she said with a sigh: What! am I then to
thee but a Rákshasi, and only an impostor?
And the King said: Dear Guru, every Rákshasi
can assume at will a form of more than
mortal beauty, and this very beauty of thine
makes thee suspicious in my eyes, for nothing
like it was ever seen.  And yet I would rather
be devoured by thee than die in any other
way, or fall, as is probable, in battle.
</p>

<p>
And she looked at him a moment, and then
she said: Thou art very young, and as I
think, hardly older than myself: and hast thou,
then, been present in many battles?  And he
said: In some.  Then she said: How is it,
then, that thou art still alive?  And the King
laughed, and said: Dearest little Guru, there
would be no battles, if in every battle all were
killed.  And she said: But thy own father
was killed in battle, and one day, it may be
thy case also.  And Chand said: Who knows?
For some fall, on their very first field: and
others spend their whole lives on battle-fields,
and Death flies from them continually, as if
he was afraid of them himself.  Or, it may
be, he chooses whom he pleases.  Then she
said: And art thou, then, not afraid, lest he
should choose thee?
</p>

<p>
And Chand looked at her, for a while, in
silence.  And all at once he said: Who can
escape what is written on his forehead?  And
if a brave man fall in battle, what harm?  For
he must die somehow, and in that case, at any
rate, the Apsaras appointed for him waits, to
carry off his soul.  But I have found my
Apsaras, while I am alive.  Ha! and now
that I bethink me, surely that is what
thou art.  Aye! doubtless I am dead,
having died somehow or other, unawares, and
thou art the very Apsaras that has come to
fetch away my soul.  And who knows but
that this arbour of thine is a very bit of
heaven, lifted as it is above the lower world,
among the clouds?
</p>

<p>
And all at once, she exclaimed, with
emphasis: Never shall the Apsarases take thee.
Thou shalt never fight on any battle-field
again.  And then again, she stopped short,
while the colour rushed over her face like
dawn.  And instantly, the King started to his
feet, exclaiming with rapture: Ah!  Guru of
my heart!  What! would my death displease
thee?  And she said, with confusion: Nay,
I did but fear for thy life, on some future
day.  But look! where my flower lies, that I
gave thee, to treasure for a <i>yuga</i>.  Already
dost thou neglect it?  For in his emotion, the
King had thrown it to the ground.  And she
said again: See! in the confusion caused by
matters of more moment, how the poor flower
falls neglected to the ground!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
XVII
</p>

<p>
And the King picked the flower up, and
laid it carefully upon the seat.  And he said:
Lie thou there, my flower, securely: I will see
to it, that thou dost never fall to the ground
again.  And then, he turned to the King's
daughter, and made a step towards her, with
such determination, that she drew back in
alarm.  And she faltered, half in play and
half in fear: Beware!  O Intruder: thou art
transgressing the conditions.  But the King
swept away her expostulation with a wave of
his hand.  And he exclaimed: Nay, I care not
any longer whether I am here by right or
wrong: it is enough that I am here, and thou
art there.  And well didst thou ask me,
whether I feared to fall in battle like my
father.  For never hitherto had I fear of any
kind, but at thy very question, I suddenly
understood that I was changed.  Did I not
say, thou wert a witch, transforming me into
another man by spells?  For now I know I
am a coward, and afraid to die, since should
I die, I should never see thee any more.  And
all at once he stooped, till his left hand rested
on her basket, to look up into her face, which
was turned towards the ground.  And he said
with a voice that shook with emotion: Dear
Guru, come, wilt thou not choose me, and
throw round my neck the garland of thy
choice?  And I will be thy slave, and do
everything according to thy bidding, and abandon,
if thou wilt, my battles and my kingdom and
my life, and every other thing, counting the
world as grass, only to sit beside thee and
listen to thy voice, and watch thee, and thy
eyes and thy hands and thy hair and whatever
else is thine and part of thee.  Aye! and
what does it matter, if formerly I thought
lightly of thy sex?  I was but a fool, that
did not know, and now I will make up to
thee for all, and serve thee, and follow thee
about, and obey thee like a dog.  Aye!  I
have cast my whole life into the fire, and
thrown it behind me like a dream, out of which
I have awoken, as thou hast waked me, with
a start: for now I see that it was horrible,
and black, and cold and vain and worthless;
for what is any life in which thou art not
but a death, and worse than any death, to have
seen thee, and to be without thee, even for
an hour.  Aye! now I know, though then I
knew it not, that the very first moment I set
eyes on thee, I ceased to be myself, for it is
thou that art myself, and my soul, and
without thee I am nothing but a corpse.  Only
tell me what there is of me which thou dost
not like, and I will change it, if only thou
wilt help me: for thou art powerful to change.
For I am very rude, and need teaching, and
thou shalt teach me anything thou wilt.  And
if there is anything thou longest for, I will
search the world to bring it to thy feet, and
fetch for thee no matter what from the very
bottom of the sea.  Only let me serve thee,
no matter how: see, I am very strong, and
if thou wilt, will carry thee about; and O,
that only someone would attack thee, that I
might show thee by experience that I could
fight for thee like never another in the world!
Aye! death itself would be delicious, were it
only given as a ransom for thy life.

<p>
So as he spoke, she listened, standing as if
rooted to the ground, with a bosom that rose
and fell in agitation, and eyes that did not
dare to leave the floor.  And when he ended,
all at once, she looked up.  And she cast a
single glance, rapid as a flash of lightning,
at his face, that resembled the face of one that
begged for mercy, for his eyes were full of
tears; and then once more she bounded like a
deer towards the cliff, and stood again upon its
very verge, with her back towards him,
looking out over the gorge.  And all at once she
stooped, and covered her face with her hands.
And so she stood awhile; and at last, she took
her hands from her face, and turned round.
</p>

<p>
And she looked at the King, with hard eyes,
and a face paler than the ashes on the body
of a Pashupata ascetic.  And she said, very
low, and very clear, and very slowly: O King
Chand, the Guru has arrived.
</p>

<p>
And instantly, the King turned like
lightning to the door.  And seeing nothing, he
listened, and he said: Here there is nobody.
Then she looked at him strangely, and said
again: There is no Guru.  I am myself the
Guru.  And as he continued to gaze at her,
in perplexity, not understanding, she
continued: O King Chand, thy original
opinions about women were, after all, the truth.
For a woman is after all, nothing, but a mass
of deception, and a traitor, and now I have
betrayed thee, and led thee straight into a trap.
</p>

<p>
And as the King still remained gazing
silently at her in amazement, she said yet
again: Thou hast all along imagined, that
I was here by a chance, and our meeting was
unpremeditated, and accidental: and yet it is
not so.  For I came here by express design
and policy, to catch thee: and Yogeshwara
led thee to my arbour by my advice and
prearrangement, hoping to hook thee, and snare
thee, by means of me, the bait and the decoy,
in the meshes of his policy, making thee his
instrument by means of me.  And now, thou
hast learned a lesson, and verified thy faith
by experience, and thy dislike of women is,
as thou seest, altogether solid, and founded
on the truth.
</p>

<p>
And as she ended, the King stood staring
at her, in a stupor, and like one whose senses
have been annihilated by an overwhelming
blow.  And he saw before him not the woman
that she was immediately before, but another
altogether different.  For her face resembled
a very beautiful and stony mask, ice-cold,
suddenly put on, as it were to hide the soul
concealed below.
</p>

<p>
So as he stood, recollection suddenly came
back into his heart.  And he said to himself:
Thus, then, the very thing predicted by my
ministers, has actually occurred.  And like a
silly fowl, I have actually rushed into the trap,
so skilfully prepared by Yogeshwara to catch
me, with open eyes, forewarned.
</p>

<p>
And at the thought of Yogeshwara, all at
once, pride, and utter shame, and rage rushed
as it were all together into his soul, and the
blood left his heart, and surged up into his
brow, and lifted the very hair upon his head.
And suddenly, he bowed before the King's
daughter, standing absolutely still before him,
like a picture painted on a wall.  And he
said slowly: King Mitra is very fortunate
in possessing such a minister, and such a
daughter; and I did very wrong, in remaining
even for a single instant, in an arbour to which
I never should have come.
</p>

<p>
And then, he turned, and left the arbour.
And she stood, absolutely still, watching
him go.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
XIX
</p>

<p>
So as he went away, the soul of Yogeshwara,
in his ambush, almost leaped from his body,
so extreme was his rage, and disgust, and
disappointment, to see him go.  And he
exclaimed within himself: Ha! what! am I
awake, or only dreaming?  What! after
lifting the matter to the very topmost pinnacle
of success, has she actually dashed it, with a
single stroke, to the very bottom, making
everything worse by far than it was at the
beginning?  Is she mad, or what in the world
can be the matter with her?  Ha! now she
has very effectually ruined herself, and her
father, and me, and the kingdom, and all.
Could she not hold her woman's tongue, and
keep the secret?  Ha! now indeed, all is lost.
For now like a mad elephant he will be back
upon us, in a very little while, to wreak his
rage upon us all, and tear up the kingdom
and the tree of my policy, by its very roots.
Fool that I was, to stake all upon the
discretion of a girl!
</p>

<p>
And all at once, he stopped short, struck
with the thunderbolt of astonishment at the
behaviour of the King's daughter.  For when
the King was gone, she stood awhile, looking
at the door, by which he had disappeared,
motionless as a tree, and turning paler and
ever paler, till her face resembled the marble
floor on which she stood.  And suddenly she
turned round.  And as fate would have it, at
that moment, her eyes fell on the seat, where
he sat, and on the flower, that lay there,
exactly as he placed it, when he lifted it with
such affection from the floor.  And she looked
at it, for a single instant, and all at once,
she flung herself upon her knees, with her face
buried in her two arms, that rested on her
basket, and she began to sob, as if, her heart
being broken, she was about to break herself
in pieces also.
</p>

<p>
And as he watched her, tears of compassion
for her and her condition arose, as if against
his will, in Yogeshwara's soul: for he had a
daughter of his own.  And he gazed at her
distracted, and seizing his right ear with his
hand, he began to pull it, utterly confounded
and perplexed as to what was to be done.
And he said within himself: Surely some
assistance should be rendered to this unhappy
maiden, no matter what blame she has
incurred by her incomprehensible and utterly
disastrous behaviour.  For she seems about to
abandon the body, in grief about something
or other, as great as I have ever witnessed in
my life.  And yet if I go to her assistance,
it will come out that I was a party to their
interview, and that will never do.  And yet
I cannot stay here and watch her, as it were,
dying before my eyes, in the very agony of
grief.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
XX
</p>

<p>
And then, once again he stopped short, and
so great was his amazement that he came
within a very little of betraying himself by
a loud exclamation.  For as he looked, lo! the
King appeared again, standing in the door,
having returned unheard with silent steps.
And as he stood, he looked towards the King's
daughter, all unaware of his return.  And
when he saw that she was sobbing, like a very
incarnation of despair, all at once his face was
lit up as it were by the ecstasy of joy.  And
he went noiselessly, on tiptoe, towards her,
and when he reached her, he stood for a
moment looking down at her, with compassion
that was mingled with unutterable affection.
And then, he stooped down, and touched her
on the shoulder, very gently, with his hand.
</p>

<p>
And at his touch, she started to her feet,
and stood, with downcast eyes, from which
great tears rolled, chasing one another, along
her cheeks, and a bosom that heaved like the
ocean after a storm.  And the colour came
and went upon her face, like the shadows of
the clouds driven furiously over the hillsides
by a strong wind.
</p>

<p>
And the King leaned towards her, and said
softly: See, it is fated, that I cannot leave
thy arbour, however often I may try.  And
now, thou art mistaken.  For it was my old
opinions of women that are wrong, and my
new ones that are right.  And now, dear
Guru, wilt thou choose me for thy husband,
or not?
</p>

<p>
And as he stretched his hands towards her,
she glanced at him, and all at once, she lost
control over herself, and abandoned, as it
were, the dominion of her soul to him.  And
she fell into his arms, and remained, sobbing
on his breast, and quivering with emotion, and
joy, and shame, while the whole world swam
in mist before the eyes of the King, trembling
like a leaf in the whirlwind of passion roused
by her agitation and her surrender and her
touch.  And after a while, he said: Listen,
for I wish to ask thee a question, and tell
thee why it was that I returned.  For it was
not only thy beauty that drew me back again,
though that alone would have made it utterly
impossible for me to go away: notwithstanding
Yogeshwara, whom, at the thought of his
deception, I was ready to strangle with my
own hands.  But all at once, as I went, I
stopped.  And I said: Ha! why did she
betray herself, and tell me, when she had
completely gained her object, what without her, I
myself should never have discovered?  Could
it be, because her heart smote her, to receive
the husband of her choice?
</p>

<p>
And then, with a cry, she gripped him by
the arm.  And she sobbed aloud as she
exclaimed: Ah! thou hast guessed it, thou hast
guessed.  Ah! till I knew thee, to deceive thee
seemed to be a little thing.  And fool!  I laid
a snare for thee, never dreaming of danger to
myself, nor thinking that I should be the first
myself to fall into the snare, laid for me by
the Deity in thy dear form.  And as I looked
at thee, and listened to thee pleading, all
ignorant of my deception, all at once I became a
thing of horror to myself, and saw myself a
traitor, to thee.  Ah! no, not to thee.  Ah! to
thee, to thee, ah! to thee I could not lie.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
XXI
</p>

<p>
So those two lovers stood together in that
arbour on the edge of the hill, not knowing
where they were, and all ignorant of time.
And the King's daughter sobbed, until she
laughed, and laughed until she sobbed, till at
length the King took her in his arms, and
seating himself in his old seat, set her on his
lap, and held her like a child, rocking her to
and fro, and wishing that her agitation might
never have an end, so only that he might
continue rocking her for ever on his knee.
</p>

<p>
And at last, becoming once more mistress
of herself, she said to him in a whisper: Thou
didst well to return, without losing any time.
For hadst thou remained absent but a very
little longer, I would have thrown myself to
the bottom of the cliff, and then they would
have found there not, as thou saidst, thy bones,
but mine.  But as it is, I am alive, to be
already a burden to thee, and as yet, the <i>yuga</i>
has only just begun.  And he said: O burden,
I am not in any hurry to set thee down.
And I will carry my flower, thou shalt find,
to the <i>yuga's</i> very furthest end.
</p>

<p>
And as he spoke, she turned in his arms,
and looked towards the flower, and she said,
very low: When, after thy departure,
suddenly I saw the flower that I gave thee
lying, left by thee, despised, alone, there came
into my heart such an agony, that death itself
would have been relief.  And the King said,
with emotion: I will build for it a shrine of
gold: but as for thee, thy shrine is in my
heart.  But now, O Guru of my heart, there
is still something to be done: for thou hast
not yet placed thy garland on my neck.
</p>

<p>
And instantly she jumped up and brought
it.  And she said: With my own hands, I
wove it for thee, and the charm that I sang
to it, unknown to thee, for thee, has produced
its result.  And as the King stood before her,
she reached up, with a smile, on tiptoe, and
put the garland round his neck, together with
the other garland of the creeper of her arms.
And the King drew her, with his own arms,
towards him, and their souls met upon their
lips, and lost in each other, became inextricably
united, in the paradise-oblivion of a kiss
without an end.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
And old Yogeshwara, in his ambush, said
softly to himself, with tears in his eyes: Now
it is time for me to go, for now I am superfluous;
and this is the end, and the battle is
won.  And she was right, and I was wrong;
and she alone knew her way to the only true
and perfect end, without which all was
incomplete; and I am nothing but an old fool.
And in my folly I actually ventured to chide
her, and reprove her, not perceiving that it
was not she, but I, who was to blame, coming
within a very little of utterly destroying all,
by my presumptuous and impertinent interference,
unable to appreciate her incomparable
skill, and conceitedly deeming myself a better
judge as to how this matter ought to be
conducted to a successful termination, than
herself: as if a woman and the Deity of Love
did not know how to manage their own business
better than all the grey-haired dotards in
the three great worlds!

<h3>
A Cordial Understanding
</h3>

<p>
And the very next morning, King Mitra's
capital went as it were wild with joy, with
smiles in the form of red banners hung from
every housetop, and laughter in the form of
drums beaten in every street, and shouts of
victory in every mouth: since all had heard
that King Chand was going to marry the
King's daughter, and so would the hereditary
enemy become a friend.[<a id="chap03fn1text"></a><a href="#chap03fn1">1</a>]  And the marriage
was celebrated with all its rites, with speed
that did not however keep pace with King
Chand's impatience, who almost lost his reason
on account of the delay of the astrologers in
fixing the auspicious day.  And as soon as
he had led his bride with trembling hand
around the fire, he took her away to his own
home.
</p>

<p>
And as he went away, Yogeshwara said to
him, at the city gate: O King Chand, dost
thou bear a grudge against the old minister
that lured thee into a snare?  And Chand
laughed, and said: O Yogeshwara, I wish I
had a minister like thee.  And as to the
grudge, I owe thee what I am anxious to
repay.  Come to my capital below, when thou
hast leisure, and ask me for anything whatever
of most value to thee in the three worlds,
and it is thine.  And Yogeshwara said
instantly: I choose thy bride.  And Chand
laughed again, and said: It is well chosen:
and now I see, that thy reputation for wisdom
is well deserved.  Nevertheless, thou wilt
have to choose again, for thou hast asked for
the only thing I will not give.
</p>

<p>
So then, as they went away, Yogeshwara
said softly to himself: Now, were I only a
young man, my fortune would be made.  But
as it is, I am old, and my work is done: and
I have attained the fruit of my birth.  And
see! how the Deity, in this case, as frequently
before, has brought about things contrary to
all expectation, and such as no man could have
believed even to be possible, by the very
simplest means.  For King Chand and his son
have done nothing all their lives, but subdue
the regions of the earth: whereas King Mitra
has done absolutely nothing, except marry a
wife and beget a daughter.  And yet, aided
by my policy, this daughter has, like a
wishing-tree, dropped all Chand's gains into our
lap, and so far from losing anything, we have
gained all.  So much more powerful has
proved this slender digit of the moon than all
the fury of the sun.  And now, then, I will
put off the burden of the State, and spend the
days that still remain to me in accumulating
merit, by penance and austerities.

<p>
And he handed over everything to his son,
and becoming a pilgrim, went to Wáránasi.
And there he took up his station on the margin
of the holy stream, and sat there, motionless
and speechless, till he died.  And they made
a pyre and burned him on the Ghat: and his
soul entered another body, while the ashes of
the old one floated down the river, and were
lost at last in the waters of the sea.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
And then, Maheshwara stopped.
</p>

<p>
And after a while, the Daughter of the
Mountain said softly: O Moony-Crested, thy
story, after all, proves absolutely nothing.
For beyond a doubt, Chand would have loved
his beautiful and crafty mountain-bride every
whit as much, had she never committed any
fault at all.
</p>

<p>
Then said the God: O Daughter of the
Snow, thou art altogether mistaken.  For the
fact that he had, as it were, to forgive her
for a fault, in the very crisis and ecstasy of his
passion, increased it not merely a hundred,
but a thousand-fold, and enriched it with a
sweetness which otherwise it could never have
possessed.  And so it is in every other case:
for therein lies the flattery of sex.[<a id="chap03fn2text"></a><a href="#chap03fn2">2</a>]  And each
sex loves the other better, if it love at all, for
having something to forgive.  For nothing
augments affection so much as the forgiveness
of its object.  And the tests of love are
only two, the power of recollection, and the
capacity to forgive.  For false love forgets
at once, and cannot forgive at all.  But love
that is really love forgives for ever, and never
forgets.
</p>

<p>
Then said the mountain goddess: But in
what, then, lies the superiority of sex to sex,
and man to woman?  And why is not he a
mine of faults, as well as she?
</p>

<p>
And as she spoke, she was conscious of a
change: and all at once she looked, and found
that she was lying, not on the Great God's
breast, but on the green side of a hill.  And
instantly she exclaimed, in a pet: Now he
has cheated me again, suddenly substituting
this green hill for his own body, and going
somewhere else, leaving me in the lurch,
without an answer to my doubt.  And now I shall
have to wait, until he chooses to return.  And
doubtless he thinks, that after a little while,
I shall have utterly forgotten all about it;
but on the contrary, I will very carefully
remember to make him answer, and I will take
my hair down, and keep it so, until he does.
And in the meantime, I will go, and listen to
my own praises; and show myself, it may be,
for a moment, in return for them, to my
worshippers in the Windhya hills.

"Mr. Bain's stories are full of wistfulness and
beauty.  There is a tenderness, a richness of color,
a warmth of passion, and an elemental understanding
of men and women....  They seem to me
to place Mr. Bain on an eminence isolated and
unique....  No words that I can write can
fittingly express the fascination of these
books."&mdash;Mr. E. V. Lucas in the <i>London Bookman</i>.

"Charming love stories that will be absolutely
novel to most readers.  They are delicate, vivid,
and told in beautiful English.  They show Hindu
life and thought in the true light, a thing worth
doing in view of the mushy mysticisms and
theosophical gibbering that have obscured it in
this country."&mdash;<i>N. Y. Sun</i>.

<p class="t2b">
GREAT POSSESSIONS
</p>

<p class="t3b">
By MRS. WILFRID WARD
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Ward's latest book is the romance
of a mysterious bequest.  Sir David Bright,
a distinguished soldier and prominent
figure in London society, has died leaving
the bulk of his immense fortune not to his
wife, but to an unknown woman living in
Florence.  Starting with this somewhat
melodramatic situation, the author has told
a fascinating story of London life marked
by pictures of the great world, a
presentation at court, and all the lesser
observances of fashionable society, with moving
and sympathetic character studies, and
throughout a strong and striking plot.
<i>The Great Possessions</i> might be called the
English <i>House of Mirth</i>.

SAN CELESTINO
</p>

<p class="t3b">
BY JOHN AYSCOUGH
</p>

<p class="t3b">
Author of "MAROTZ," "DROMINA," etc.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In form, it is almost exactly like a novel with
frequent conversations, and going, in minor matters
at least, far beyond the record of history.  The
narrative opens with Petruccio as a child in the home
of his parents, who belong to the minor nobility
of the Abruzzi.  It follows his career at Salerno,
where he attended the University as a lonely
figure making few friends.  Afterwards he became a
hermit and the story tells how disciples gathered
round him, beginning with two worldly young men
who had known him at Salerno.  The Order of
the Celestines thus founded grew in numbers and
importance through fifty quiet years, when the call
to the Papacy came.  From this point, Mr. Ayscough's
chronicle moves swiftly and dramatically&mdash;the
poor simple old man dragged weeping from his
hermit's cave and borne to the triumph from which
he shrank in horror,&mdash;the miserable weeks in
Rome, touching examples of his simplicity and
guilelessness.  Then the peace which came with
the renunciation, and his last days passed quite
happily as a captive in a prison cell.

By its stirring dramatic appeal, its varied
interest, its skilful artistry, Miss
MacGowan's new Tennessee mountain story
marks a long step in advance of her
earlier novels.  It is an interesting company
that is brought together in this
book&mdash;notably the proud high-spirited mountain
beauty who is the heroine, and the bold
and fiery young hero, who will surely stand
high in the good graces of readers of the
tale&mdash;and a company of distinct types
drawn with a graphic and spirited hand, a
company moved by strong passions&mdash;love,
and hate too, green jealousy and black
revenge.
